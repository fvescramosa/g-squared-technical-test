I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Joseph Hayden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10949\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"WordPress 5.8 Release Candidate 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 01:09:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10933\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:303:\"The third release candidate for WordPress 5.8 is now available!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 15:11:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:334:\"Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:40</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, we hosted WordCamp Europe and had the double pleasure of a demo that showed us a bit about the future of WordPress and an interview that looked back while also looking a bit forward. If you haven&#8217;t seen the demo, it was beautiful. And I&#8217;ve included a link to it in the show notes. And if you haven&#8217;t heard the interview, there were a few specific moments that I&#8217;d like to take the time to delve into a little more. Brian Krogsgard, in his conversation with Matt Mullenweg, brought up three really interesting points. I mean, he brought up a lot of interesting points, but there were three that I would particularly like to look into today. The first was about balance. The second was about cohesion. And the third was about those we leave behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 01:24</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first is this question of balance. Brian brought this up in the context of the overall economic health of the WordPress ecosystem. And in that particular moment, he talked about companies that are coming together, companies that are merging. And in Matt&#8217;s answer, the part that I found the most interesting was when he said, &#8220;the point at which there is the most commercial opportunity is also the point at which there is the most opportunity for short-termism. He went on to talk about the importance of long-term thinking and collective thinking about what makes us, and us here means probably the WordPress project, more vibrant and vital in 10 or 20 or 30 years. One of the things that he specifically called out in that answer was the responsibility of larger companies in the ecosystem. For instance, like Automattic, to commit fully to giving back, there are many ways now that companies can give back to WordPress so that we all replenish the Commons. They can pay for volunteer contributors&#8217; time; they can create and sponsor entire teams through the Five for the Future program. They can contribute time through our outreach program. And they can even contribute to WordPress&#8217;s ability to own our own voice by engaging their audience&#8217;s awareness of what&#8217;s next in WordPress, or whatever. And I know this balance, this particular balance of paid contributors or sponsored contributors, compared to our volunteer contributors or self-sponsored contributors; I know that this balance is one that people keep an eagle eye on. I am consistently on a tight rope to appropriately balanced those voices. But as with so many things where balance is key, keeping an eye on the middle or the long-distance can really help us get it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 03:23</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second question was one of cohesion and specifically cohesion over the competition. Brian asked how, if people feel disadvantaged, you can foster a feeling of cohesion rather than competition? And Matt&#8217;s first answer was that competition is great. Specifically, he said that competition is great as long as you consider where your collaboration fits into the mission. And he also spent some time exploring how competitors in the ecosystem can still work from a community-first mindset. I personally cannot agree enough about some of the benefits of collaboration alongside your competitors. I remind sponsored contributors from time to time, and I think it&#8217;s true for any contributor that you are an employee of your company first and a contributor to WordPress second. However, once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project. So you get all this subject matter expertise from competitive forces, collaborating in a very us versus the problem way. And when you do that, you&#8217;re always going to find a great solution. It may not be as fast as you want it to build things out in the open in public. And so sometimes we get it wrong and have to come back and fix it but still, given time, we&#8217;re going to come out with the best solution because we have so many skilled people working on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 05:01</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third question that I wanted to really touch on is the question of those we leave behind. Brian asked Matt if he thought mid-sized agencies and mid-sized consultants were being squeezed out with the block editor. Matt&#8217;s high-level answer was no, and I tend to agree with him. It&#8217;s not all mid-sized anything any more than it&#8217;s all small-sized anything. His answer continued to look at what stands to change for users with the block editor and who really can stand to benefit. It made me think back to my WordPress 5.0 listening tour. We launched WordPress 5.0, which was, in case anyone forgets, the first release with the block editor in it. I took a six-month-long tour to anywhere that WordPressers were so I could hear their main worries, what Brian is saying in there, and what Matt is saying to really came up all the time in those conversations. And basically, it was that this update takes all the power away from people who are building websites. And in these conversations, and Matt and Brian&#8217;s conversation, it was really focused on our freelancers and consultants. But at the same time, all of them heard that this update gives power back to all of the people who could build websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 06:28</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not shake the feeling at the time. And honestly, I can&#8217;t shake it now that no high-end consultants, or freelancers, or any other developer or site creator sit around just longing for maintenance work. After six months of talking to people, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone say, &#8220;you know, I just love making the same author card over and over and over.&#8221; Or, &#8220;updated the footer every week, this month. And that&#8217;s why I got into this business.&#8221; And more than the feeling that there just wasn&#8217;t anyone who just loved maintenance, I got a feeling that there were real problems that needed to be solved for these clients and that they wanted to solve them. And that they also would gladly trade updating footers for the much more interesting work of creating modern and stylish business hubs based on WordPress for the clients who trust them so much. All of that, I guess, is to say that, yes, the block editor does give power back to our clients again, but not at the expense of those who have to build the sites in the first place. I think it stands to restore everyone&#8217;s sense of agency more than we truly realize. So that&#8217;s my deep dive on WordCamp Europe; I included links to the demo and the talk below, just in case you haven&#8217;t seen them yet. And you want to get a little bit of insight into the full context of the conversations that I just did a bit of a deep dive into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 08:15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. All right, I have three things for you today. Number one, tomorrow, we package WordPress 5.8 beta three. If you&#8217;ve never had a chance to stop by the core channel in slack for the past packaging process, I really encourage you to stop by; we call them release parties. It&#8217;s a bunch of people who stand around and help get it done. So you can also see how it gets done. And if you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can even try your hand at testing out one of the packages as soon as it&#8217;s ready. The second thing is that a week from tomorrow, we reach our first release candidate milestone. So if you have meant to submit any bugs or patches or if you&#8217;ve been procrastinating on documentation, or dev notes, right now is the time so that we can have a chance to get everything into the release by the time we reach the release candidate milestone on the 29th. And the third thing is that we are currently right in the middle of WordCamp Japan. That is a great opportunity to meet some contributors and maybe even get started with contributions yourself. So stop by if you haven&#8217;t had a chance to check it out already. I will leave a link in the show notes.

Let&#8217;s start with some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Powerful Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discover several new blocks and expressive tools, including blocks for&nbsp;<em>Page Lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>Site Title</em>,&nbsp;<em>Logo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tagline</em>. A powerful&nbsp;<em>Query Loop</em>&nbsp;block offers multiple ways for displaying lists of posts and comes with new block patterns that take advantage of its flexibility and creative possibilities.</li><li>Interacting with nested blocks has been made easier with a permanent toolbar button for selecting a parent. Block outlines are shown when hovering or focusing on the different block type buttons. Block handles are now also present for drag and drop when in “select” mode.</li><li>Introduces the&nbsp;<strong>List View</strong>, a panel that can be toggled and helps navigate complex blocks and patterns.</li><li>Reusable blocks have an improved creation flow and support for history revisions. </li><li>A cool new duotone block adds images effects which can be used in media blocks or supported in third-party blocks. Color presets can also be customized by the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handpicked Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns can now also be recommended and selected during block setup, offering powerful new flows.

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who has ever organized something, whether it&#8217;s a social event, a school project, or an annual family gathering, you know that there are many different opinions. The more opinions you have, the more likely people don&#8217;t see eye to eye. And before you know it, you&#8217;ve got some disagreements. Some things make disagreements worse, like imbalance of information, lack of showing your work, and sometimes just “too many cooks in the kitchen,” to use a regional phrase. Frankly, sometimes it seems like the second you have more than one cook in your kitchen, you&#8217;re going to get some disagreements. But I think that&#8217;s a healthy thing. WordPress is huge. And there are huge numbers of people contributing to WordPress or any other open source project you want to name. So there&#8217;s a lot of stuff available to disagree about. If we never saw anyone pointing out an area that wasn&#8217;t quite right, there would probably be something wrong. If you, like me, think that a healthy tension of collaborative disagreement can be useful when approached thoughtfully, then this quick start guide is for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step one, prepare to host a discussion. This is, by the way, just the hardest step out there. You have to take a little time to figure out what problem you&#8217;re solving with the solution you&#8217;re suggesting, any goals that it relates to, and then figure out what the bare minimum best outcome would be and what the wildest dreams magic wand waving outcome would be. And you have to be honest with yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step two, host the discussion. The venue will be different for different discussions, but you see a lot of these on team blogs or within the actual tickets where work is being done. Wherever you&#8217;re hosting it, state the problem, state your idea for the solution and ask for what you missed. If you&#8217;re hosting a discussion in person, like in a town hall format, this can be hard. And generally, hosting discussions in an in-person or voice call or zoom call kind of way is hard. So if you have an opportunity to start doing this in text first and level your way up to in person, that&#8217;s my recommendation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step three is to summarize the discussion and post a decision if possible. So organizing a big discussion into main points is a really good practice for the people you&#8217;re summarizing it for and yourself. It helps you to confirm your understanding, and it also gives you the chance to pair other solutions with the problem and goals you outlined in step one. If a different solution solves the same problem but with less time or effort, it&#8217;s worth taking a second look with less time or effort. There’s something that I say to WordPress contributors frequently, and that is there are a lot of yeses. There are a lot of right ways to do things and only a few clear wrong ways to do things. So be open-minded about whether or not someone else&#8217;s right way to do things could still achieve the goals you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with your solution. A note on step three where I said, “and post the decision if possible.” Sometimes you&#8217;re the person to make that decision, but sometimes you are not the person who can give something the green light, and so you&#8217;re preparing a recommendation. Whether you&#8217;re making a decision or a recommendation, sometimes you may experience a little decision-making paralysis. I know I do. So here are a few of the tools that I use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re avoiding the decision, use the 10/10/10 rule; it can help you figure out if you&#8217;re stuck on a short-term problem. If there are too many good choices, use the Eisenhower Matrix that can help you to prioritize objectively. If there are too many bad choices, use the Maximin strategy. It can help you to identify how to minimize any potential negative impacts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you&#8217;ve considered your position. You’ve discussed everything. You summarized the big points. Maybe you also worked your way through to a recommendation or a decision. What about everyone who disagreed with the decision? Or have you made a recommendation, and it wasn&#8217;t accepted? How do you deal with that? That&#8217;s where “disagree and commit” shows up. This phrase was made popular by the folks over at Amazon, I think. But it first showed up, I believe at Sun Microsystems as this phrase, “agreeing, commit, disagree and commit or get out of the way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disagree and commit as a concept works pretty well when everyone agrees on the vision and the goals, but not necessarily how to get to those goals. We&#8217;ve had moments in recent history where folks we&#8217;re not able to agree, we’re not able to commit, and so then left the project. I hate when that happens. I want people to thrive in this community for the entire length of their careers. But I also understand that situation shows up in the top five learnings of open source when you no longer have interest in the project and handed it off to a competent successor. So there it is &#8211; disagreements in open source in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with so many of the things I discuss on this podcast, this is incredibly complex and nuanced in practice. Taking an argument, distilling facts from feelings, and adjusting frames of reference until the solution is well informed and risk-balanced. That is a skill set unto itself. But one that increases the health of any organization. I’ll share that list of references and general materials in the show notes, including a link explaining each of those decision-making tools that I shared. I&#8217;m also going to include the contributor training module on decision-making in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s got excellent information. It&#8217;s part of a series of modules that I asked team reps to take and sponsored contributors. I don&#8217;t require it from anyone, but I do hope that it is useful for you. Also, speaking of useful for you, if you are just here for leadership insights, I included some hot takes after the outro music for you. It&#8217;s like an Easter egg, but I just told you about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to our small list of big things! First off, WordCamp Europe is happening this we; I hope that everybody has an opportunity to attend. If you still haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets, they are free, and I think there are still a few left. I will include a link in the show notes as well. There&#8217;s going to be a little demo with Matt Mullenweg and Matias Ventura on the WordPress 5.8 release that&#8217;s coming up. And then kind of a retrospective discussion between Matt and Brian Krogsgard. I encourage you to join; I think it&#8217;s going to be very interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also WordCamp, Japan coming up June 20 through 26th. I mentioned it last time &#8211;&nbsp; it has a big section of contributing and contribution time. So if you&#8217;re looking to get started, some projects are laid out, and I encourage you to take a look at that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new thing on this list, and I don&#8217;t know how new It is, in general, I hope it&#8217;s not too new to you, is that WordPress 5.8 release is reaching its beta one milestone on June 8th, so right in the middle of WordCamp Europe. I encourage every single theme developer, plugin developer that we have, agency owners that we have to really take a look at this release and dig into testing it. It&#8217;s a gigantic release. And I have so many questions about what will work and will not work once we get it into a broader testing area. We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of testing in the outreach program. But it&#8217;s always helpful to get people who are using WordPress daily in their jobs to really give a good solid test to the beta product to the beta package. And put it all through its paces for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey there, you must be here because I told you about this totally not hidden easter egg about my hot takes on organizational health; I have three for you. And if you&#8217;ve ever worked with me, none of this will surprise you. But if you haven&#8217;t worked with me, hopefully, it kind of gives you some idea about how I approach all of this a bit differently. So, number one, critical feedback is the sign of a healthy organization. And I will never be dissuaded from that opinion. A complete lack of dissent doesn&#8217;t look like “alignment.” To me, that looks like fear. And it goes against the open source idea that many eyes make all bugs shallow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip number two, a bit of tension is good, a bit of disagreement is good. The same thing that I say about women in tech, we&#8217;re not all the same. And if we were, then we wouldn&#8217;t need to collaborate anyway. But diversity, whether that&#8217;s the diversity of thought or of a person or of experience, just doesn&#8217;t happen without some misunderstandings. It&#8217;s how we choose to grow through those misunderstandings that make all the difference for the type of organization we are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hot take number three, changing your mind isn&#8217;t flip-flopping or hypocritical. I think that&#8217;s a sign of growth and willingness to hear others. I like to think of my embarrassment at past bad decisions &#8211; as the sore muscles of a learning brain. And I, again, probably won&#8217;t be dissuaded from that opinion. Although, you know, if I&#8217;m sticking true to changing your mind some flip-flopping or hypocritical, maybe I will, but you can always try to, to give me the counter-argument for that, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

From the block toolbar, use the filter button and choose a preset:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/duotone_howto.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also choose colors from your theme’s palette, or a custom color of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the image block, duotone can be applied to both images and video in the cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/waves-a60072-67ff66.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will This Overwrite Images in My Media Library?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Images and videos in your media library will remain unchanged. The duotone effect works using <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html\">SVG filters</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/\">CSS filter property</a>, so the image or video is never modified in your library. On the one hand, this means that you can apply a filter to an image that you link to that doesn’t exist in your media library. On the other hand, this means that the filter won’t show up in RSS feeds or places that use the image URL directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I Add Duotone Colors to Blocks or Themes That I Develop?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The API for adding duotone colors to blocks is experimental in Gutenberg v10.6. Still, the documentation for using it in your own blocks can be found and will be updated under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/#color\">Supports Color</a> in the Block Editor Handbook. Themes can add duotone presets with theme.json. More information can be found under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">Global Settings &amp; Styles Presets</a> in the Block Editor Handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try it Out Now Using the Gutenberg plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The duotone feature was released in version 10.6 of the Gutenberg plugin, so you can try it out now prior to the WordPress 5.8 release in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joen/\">@joen</a> and <em><em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkaz/\">@mkaz</a></em></em></em> <em>for assistance writing and reviewing this post.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WP Briefing: Episode 9: The Cartography of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/episode-9-the-cartography-of-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 May 2021 11:55:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:159:\"In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/WP-Briefining-009.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12611:\"\n<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every episode of this podcast, you can hear me invite you to join in the WordPress project, to contribute back, to get involved. And I&#8217;m sure that every time I say that there&#8217;s at least one of you who&#8217;s like “Yes. Challenge accepted!” And you wade in sight unseen, to immerse yourselves in the cheerful cacophony of open source at scale that is WordPress. You see before you all 158 ways you can start contributing and you are exhilarated by this lostness. This you think, is the lostness of infinite possibility. And for you, I&#8217;m really thankful. My work here today would not be possible if it weren&#8217;t for the brave souls who leap into something with hope as their primary plan and tactic. You are heroes, and I thank you very much for your service. For everyone else, I&#8217;m going to give you a quick tour of where WordPress collaborates and a little bit of how they collaborate. We&#8217;ll cover the Make network, the Making WordPress Slack, events for WordPress, and a rundown of the teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the Make network. The Make network of sites can be found at make.wordpress.org. That page includes information on most of our teams. Teams like Core and Design and Community. All of those teams require some technical skills since we&#8217;re a project built around a piece of software. However, some require a little more than others. You can think of this set of sites as the desk of each team in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s where they update each other, where they host discussions, where they refine proposals, and where they coordinate admin tasks. Contributors can write posts on most sites in the network as long as they follow the guidelines and best practices. And anyone with a wordpress.org profile can join in discussions in the comments. Most work on the Make network is asynchronous, and discussions stay open for a long enough time to allow anyone in the world to weigh in when they have the time. It&#8217;s how we try to remember that we are a globally-minded project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second area is the Making WordPress Slack instance. The Making WordPress Slack instance can be found at wordpress.slack.com, and it requires an account that is associated with your wordpress.org profile. Each team in the project has a channel, although not all channels in that Slack instance, represent a standalone team. You can think of this Slack instance as a set of conference rooms. It&#8217;s where contributors connect, gain a more nuanced understanding of problems that we&#8217;re trying to solve. They host synchronous meetings and also coordinate working groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors can post in most channels, although there are a few that are restricted. We don&#8217;t have any social channels in this Slack instance, but most WordPress-ers do tend to find friends that they connect with. The work done here is synchronous, and most meetings last about an hour. There are about 35+ meetings a week, so you can basically always find someone around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last area we work is actually at WordPress events. Word Camps and WordPress meetups happen all over the world. Unless there&#8217;s a global pandemic, then they&#8217;re kind of all over the computer and at all times of day and night. You can keep track of those on wordcamp.org or on WordPress’s meetup page, which I&#8217;ve linked in the notes below. These events bring together all sorts of facets of the WordPress project. And they are an event where local WordPress communities aim to connect, inspire and educate each other. There&#8217;s always someone at these events, who knows a little bit more about WordPress than you do. If you&#8217;re headed to want to learn more about contribution, look out for any that have a contributor day or are hosting a contribution drive. These are clearly synchronous events. And when we do get back to doing them in person, they&#8217;re also tied to physical locations. When we get back to them, I encourage you to find one that&#8217;s close to you. They are incredibly valuable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s the map of the area. Those are the three big places where we get this stuff done. Let&#8217;s do a quick map of the teams themselves. If you&#8217;re a developer and you&#8217;re looking to work inside the technology space, work with code a bit, then your best chances for teams are Core and all of its related components. They&#8217;re like 50 components, including core editor and various other things. There&#8217;s also the Mobile team WP CLI, the Tide team, Security, our brand new team, Openverse, and Meta. Those all take a fairly high amount of code knowledge to contribute there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re more into design and product work, then we have a few teams for that as well. There&#8217;s of course, the Design team, but we also have Accessibility, Test, Triage, Polyglots kind of falls in there for me. But if you are a programs person, and we&#8217;re talking like programs, getting people together programs, not programs, as in programming or code. So if you&#8217;re a programs person, you&#8217;re looking more at the Community team, at the Themes team, the Plugin team, Polyglots, again, Training support, probably a number of others that have like program components in it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really interested in learning more about contributor experience, which is how we build tools, and again, programs for all of the contributors who are showing up, then the teams for you will be teams like Meta and Documentation, Hosting, the Community team, the Training team, arguably any team that has a program as part of it is considered contributor experience because that&#8217;s how we help our contributors know what to do, what not to do, how to help them get onboarded, find their way, stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re more in the communications area of things, we have quite a few teams there as well. We do have Marketing, of course, but also I think that Support ends up in our communications area, WordPress TV, obviously ends up in communications. But I think Training, Meta, Documentation, and arguably, maybe also Testing ends up in that space as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize that there are a handful of teams that I mentioned multiple times, especially Polyglots, Support, Test, Triage, Meta, Community. The reason they end up in a number of different places is that all of those teams also have a fair amount of admin and infrastructure stuff that goes into the WordPress project and community as a whole. So it touches a lot of other teams, and so they get a lot of mentions. All right. So WordPress adventurers, you now have a beginner&#8217;s map. I hope it helps, and I hope we see you around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still with me, that brings us today to my small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got four things for you, and I&#8217;m excited about all of them. The first two are events actually. WordCamp Europe is coming up from June seventh through the ninth. It will include a presentation from the WordPress project co-founder, Matt Mullenweg, so I encourage you to hop over, grab a ticket to check out the rest of the sessions that are happening while you&#8217;re there. The next one is WordCamp, Japan, which is happening June 20th through the 26th. And you heard that right that is seven whole days of WordCamp. It&#8217;s a little bit of a different format than we normally take, but it&#8217;s five days actually of contribution on ten specific projects. Then that&#8217;s bookended on either side of those contribution days, with full days of sessions. There&#8217;s some in English, but it&#8217;s primarily in Japanese. But either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really excellent event, and I encourage everyone to check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my list is not events. We have opened our sixth call for testing, it&#8217;s specifically looking at the template editing mode for Full Site Editing. It is an iteration on one of our earliest tests for the Full Site Editing outreach program. And so it has incorporated a lot of the feedback that we got in that test the first time around. So if you look at that test, which by the way, are all guided, if you&#8217;ve never tested anything before, don&#8217;t let this scare you. It&#8217;s really well written, it&#8217;s got a good guide on it and, and also allows for a little bit of exploration. But if you participated in the landing page test that we did early on, this is the follow-up to that. It incorporates a lot of the feedback that we got, so this is closing that feedback loop and I encourage you to stop by and participate in that test. It will be linked in the show notes and also I tweet about it a bit so you can run over there and find it also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;WordPress is dropping support for Internet Explorer 11. That&#8217;s happening over the summer, so around the middle of July is when that&#8217;s going to happen. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for a while you&#8217;ve been getting notifications. If you happen to get to WordPress with IE11, letting you know that that this particular browser is reaching the end of its life for support in general on the web, but now WordPress also is making the choice to drop support for that. And so there&#8217;s a post out on wordpress.org/news, which I will also link to in the show notes in case you have not heard about this yet. It shouldn&#8217;t have any immediate and noticeable effects on anyone who&#8217;s visiting a site that&#8217;s built using WordPress. There might be a few things in the dashboard that don&#8217;t work if you are administering a WordPress site from IE11. So there&#8217;s a lot of good information in that post. Give it a read and if you have questions, always feel free to stop by the Core chat and ask those as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Dropping support for Internet Explorer 11\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 May 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:337:\"Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) was released over 7 years ago and is currently used by less than 1% of all users on the Internet with usage rapidly declining.

A large majority of popular websites have already stopped supporting IE11 (including <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/m365-ie11-microsoft-edge-legacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Teams in 2020</a>), and even the Microsoft 365 apps and services will be <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/m365-ie11-microsoft-edge-legacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">dropping support later this year</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When WordPress 5.8 is released in July of this year, Internet Explorer 11 will no longer be supported.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are currently using IE11, it is strongly recommended that you switch to a more modern browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. IE11 users have been shown a warning that IE11 is considered outdated in the WordPress dashboard for the last 17+ months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already using one of the more modern browsers above, you will only be positively impacted by this change, as there are performance benefits to dropping IE11 support. However, if any other users of your site are still using IE11, it’s possible they will be affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does “dropping support” mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When support for a browser is removed from WordPress, new features are no longer tested on those browsers and are not guaranteed to function optimally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated tools that generate parts of the WordPress Core source code are also updated to exclude unsupported browsers. This means that any feature relying on these generated files will likely have bugs or stop working for users of those browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor will be the area of WordPress most heavily impacted by this change because almost all of the files related to the block editor are compiled using these automated tools. Other areas of the WordPress dashboard also use CSS built with these tools and their appearance will potentially be impacted when using IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All other areas of the code base that are IE11 specific will need to be identified, evaluated, and removed on a case-by-case basis as the rest are manually maintained. This process will begin in the WordPress 5.9 release, and will likely happen gradually over several major releases. Additionally, any bugs which are reported for IE11 will not be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How will this affect themes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No changes will be made to any of the default bundled themes as a result of this plan. No code related to IE11 support (or any other browser that may have been supported when each theme was released) will be removed from default themes. However, any new features added going forward will not be tested in IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not using a default theme, it’s still unlikely that your theme will be affected by this change. Themes typically have their own browser support policies, and changes in WordPress Core do not affect those. It’s possible that your theme author may have removed support for IE11 already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If IE11 support is important to you and you are unsure whether your theme supports IE11, it is recommended that you reach out to your theme’s developer to confirm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information on this change can be found on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/22/ie-11-support-phase-out-plan/\">Making WordPress Core blog</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 08:43:46 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 23:27:37 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}', 'no');

Advanced Editor Tools adds a &ldquo;Classic Paragraph&rdquo; block to the block editor that gives access to the TinyMCE editor with configurable rows and buttons.

It allows users to create and save post templates and easily reuse design elements throughout the WYSIWYG design process. Tiny plans to merge TinyMCE and Setka for a combined platform that will offer more than either product alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Modern day content creators are much more ambitious, and Setka allows us to meet more demanding use cases,&rdquo; Roberts said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over time, we envisage a combined editor platform that is both easy to use and powerful.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setka currently offers integrations for several CMS&rsquo;s, document management tools, and CRMs, including WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Ghost, Microsoft Sharepoint, and Hubspot. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/setka-editor/\">Setka WordPress plugin</a> integrates with the block editor and provides its own content block that can work together with other blocks on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former CEO Kate Bazilevskaya, who will be assuming the role of director of business development and partnerships at Tiny, said the team intends to focus on the CMS space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Through an array of integrations, we hope to make this visual building technology more accessible to businesses who already have a CMS in place, yet want more power in their editing tools,&rdquo; Bazilevskaya said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 04:39:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: WPBeginner Releases a Comment Moderator Solution Often Needed for Large Teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=120195\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:219:\"https://wptavern.com/wpbeginner-releases-a-comment-moderator-solution-often-needed-for-large-teams?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpbeginner-releases-a-comment-moderator-solution-often-needed-for-large-teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3607:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last week, WPBeginner released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-moderation-role/\">Comment Moderation Role</a> to the WordPress plugin directory. The plugin does a simple job of creating a single user role that can only moderate comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common use case for such a role &mdash; named &ldquo;WPB Comment Moderator&rdquo; in the admin &mdash; is for larger teams that need a separate user account to tackle moderation. WordPress has no built-in way of handling this. For one of the most extendable CMSs on the planet, this is one area where it has always fallen short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It almost feels like yesterday. In reality, it was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12104#comment:17\">10 years ago</a> when I stumbled upon a (then) year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12104\">ticket for a bug</a> that was a breaking point in a project I was working on. I needed to grant specific users on a WordPress site permission to moderate comments but not allow them to edit other things in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of you may be thinking that the <code><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#moderate_comments\">moderate_comments</a></code> capability should allow that. And, you would be correct in thinking that it <em><strong>should</strong></em>. However, that is not how it works at all. For users to edit comments, they must also be able to edit posts. It is a bit of a convoluted mess if you do a deep dive into the core code only to find hard-coded permissions checks that are impossible to override without rewriting large chunks of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would run into the same issue multiple times in the years since. I have built a few hacky, one-off workarounds for specific projects, but they were never ideal. And, I was never interested in maintaining a plugin that solved this problem because I knew it had the potential to be a bit of a pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I have seen a few other solutions, each fundamentally flawed, I am happy to see someone tackling this without exposing permissions issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPBeginner&rsquo;s Comment Moderation Role plugin works in the same way that I think such a plugin should work, at least with the roadblocks that WordPress currently puts in the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site administrators can add WPB Comment Moderator to any account via the user management admin screen. The process is the same as adding or removing any other role in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Granting the WPB Comment Moderator role to a user.\n\n\n\n<p>After adding the role to a user, that user can access the Comments admin screen. They can also see both the Dashboard and their own Profile in the admin. Except in the cases where they have another role added via a different plugin, they will not have permission to access other screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments admin screen for user with the WPB Comment Moderator role\n\n\n\n<p>Because of core WordPress&rsquo;s hard-coded permissions check, the plugin must create its own comments management screen. Most users will not notice this because it is all under the hood. The plugin only adds it when necessary, and it does not look or function any differently than the default screen. It is just a lot of code work and duplication to fix an 11-year-old reported bug in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the foundational issue is addressed in core WordPress, Comment Moderation Role is the best plugin for this job. After extensive testing, I can now say that it is now nestled firmly in my toolbox, ready to pull out when needed for a project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 22:13:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Gutenberg Times: List of WordPress Themes for Full-Site Editing and Resources\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18502\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/list-of-wordpress-themes-for-full-site-editing-and-resources/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7700:\"<p>A few people ask about WordPress Themes that are already working with the Full-Site Editing system and the new Site Editor.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Joseph Hayden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"Gutenberg Times: Theme creation, Block plugin development and the Future of WordPress — Weekend Edition #178\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-creation-block-plugin-development-and-the-future-of-wordpress-weekend-edition-17/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12172:\"<p>Howdy, my friends! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will be release next week.

Wayfinder outlines each block in the editor on hover. It then displays the block name at the upper left of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature that you will not find elsewhere is the addition of each block&rsquo;s classes at the bottom right of the box. This makes it easy for designers or users who want to quickly find a class for styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Outline of a Heading block.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also enable or disable the pieces of the UI they want to appear via the plugin&rsquo;s setting screen. However, any changes affect all of the site&rsquo;s user experiences. Currently, there are no per-user settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, the plugin seemed to work great. The hover outline experience felt smooth, and I did not need to change the default options. Wayfinder almost seemed to be everything one might look for in a block-outline solution. It was besting existing plugins in nearly every way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, things soon began rolling downhill when writing a typical blog post with nothing other than Heading, Paragraph, and Image blocks. I first noticed that I could not type the same number of words as usual on one line. My perfectly-tuned typography was breaking sooner than it should have. Spacing between paragraphs seemed a bit too large. My wide-aligned images were just a little smaller than usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user experience still felt good until this point, but the little oddities were stacking up. Something was not right. The plugin had been showered with praise on Twitter and already received three five-star reviews in its first 24 hours. Maybe my custom theme was the issue. However, similar problems arose when testing several others, such as Twenty Twenty-One, Nutmeg, and Eksell &mdash; each a well-rounded theme catered to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As clean as the plugin&rsquo;s UI is, it more often than not wrecks the theme&rsquo;s default block spacing. This becomes more noticeable as users begin adding nested layers of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is the plugin adds 18 pixels of padding around every block via its stylesheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block:not(.block-list-appender) {\n    position: relative;\n    outline: 1px dashed transparent;\n    <strong>padding: 18px;</strong>\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To the untrained eye, this may not be a visible issue in many cases. It will affect each site differently, but 18 pixels of extra padding on every block will undoubtedly mess things up to some degree unless the theme itself uses that exact same spacing in its design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more noticeable issues are seen with blocks like Social Icons:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Holy moly! Those are some gigantic social icons!\n\n\n\n<p>But, even something as basic as a List block can be misaligned:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />List block shifted out of alignment.\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can write custom CSS to overrule the plugin&rsquo;s padding. However, the last thing the WordPress community needs is a specificity war between themes and plugins. Themers already have to do this enough to wrangle blocks now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing that one <code>padding</code> rule from the plugin&rsquo;s <code>editor-style.css</code> killed 99% of its issues. Afterward, things were running like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I would explore <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-offset\">outline-offset</a></code> for spacing between the block and its outline, maybe cutting that <code>18px</code> down a bit. Because outlines are not a part of the CSS box model, it would not affect spacing. Adjustments may be necessary on a per-block basis, especially when those blocks are nested or small (e.g., Social Icons, Navigation). It would carry its own challenges but should be a less destructive course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a lesser extent, the plugin&rsquo;s <code>overflow</code> rule breaks the theme design from time to time. Its <code>position</code> and <code>outline</code> rules could overrule some edge-case block styles too, but they are necessary for the plugin to actually do its job. In particular, I could see positioning being problematic with sticky headers as we get into site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other issue might be themes that use <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements on blocks, but the plugin also needs to overwrite those to display the block name and classes list. This is likely another edge case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the issues, the plugin is ahead of the pack at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks-border/\">Gutenberg Editor Full Width Blocks Border</a> (<em>a bit of a mouthful</em>), another recent plugin to offer similar functionality, breaks custom theme design across the board. It does accomplish the job of making blocks easier to select, but the sacrifice of a WYSIWYG is not worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-block-outline/\">Editor Block Outline</a> plugin has been my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/navigate-the-content-canvas-with-the-block-editor-outline-wordpress-plugin\">go-to recommendation</a> for a while. It has a few design issues of its own, but some of those are adjustable on a per-user basis. However, as of late, it has made the editor feel sluggish. Plus, its misuse of the WordPress admin notice system for Twitter followers makes it something I&rsquo;d prefer to steer clear of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> has a similar &ldquo;block guidelines&rdquo; feature that uses a box-shadow instead of padding and an outline. It does not muck up most theme layouts with that technique. However, I have hit other style conflicts with the plugin. Plus, EditorsKit is overkill for users who simply want just one feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves us with Wayfinder. Warts and all, it is the best standalone option right now. Maybe that&rsquo;s not saying much, but it is saying something. This is a feature that is hard to nail down.  I do not envy the developers who are trying to make miracles happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sure to please many who have been on the lookout for a block outline solution. It is in a position to pull farther ahead of the competition with its relatively solid first outing. With more thorough theme testing and a bit of adjustment to its approach, it could be even better. I am eager to test future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:56:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Tijana Andrejic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10427\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/people-of-wordpress-tijana-andrejic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13617:\"<p><strong>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month to coincide with WordCamp Europe, we feature Tijana Andrejic from Belgrade, Serbia, about her journey from fitness trainer to the WordPress world, with the freelance and corporate opportunities it introduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/2021-07-Tijana-Andrejic_Featured-Img_1.jpg?resize=632%2C387&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tijana - portrait picture\" class=\"wp-image-10713\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As a professional manager with a college degree in Organizational Science and a certified fitness instructor, Tijana is nothing if not driven and goal-oriented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following her time as a fitness trainer, Tijana moved to work in IT around 2016. She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

Australian co-founders Russell Ivanovic and Philip Simpson are staying on to continue leading Pocket Casts as a part of the acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app allows users to keep all of their podcast subscriptions together in one place and sync between platforms. Previously a commercial-only app, Pocket Casts has been free since it switched to the freemium model in September 2019. Its creators have been monetizing the app through its Pocket Cast Plus tier, which gives users access to desktop apps, cloud storage, watch playback, and themes and icons for $9.99/year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2018, Pocket Casts was acquired by public media organizations NPR, WNYC Studios, WBEZ Chicago, and This American Life. BBC Studios also held a small ownership stake in the platform prior to Automattic&rsquo;s acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being widely regarded as one of the best podcasting apps available, NPR&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf\">financial statements and auditor&rsquo;s report from 2020</a> shows a net loss of more than $800K. The board governing the company met in December 2020 and agreed to sell Pocket Casts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No financial details of the acquisition were disclosed but Automattic may have gotten a bargain on Pocket Casts if its other owners were also losing money. After acquiring <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-day-one-journaling-app\">Day One</a>, Automattic is starting to gain a reputation for buying up apps that people love to use and giving them a fighting chance at financial stability and longevity. The company has also demonstrated a growing interest in podcasting-related technologies with its  recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/castos-picks-up-756k-in-funding-from-automattic-and-joost-de-valk-to-expand-services-in-the-private-podcasting-market\">investment in Castos</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/02/22/turn-your-wordpress-com-blog-into-a-podcast-with-anchor/\">partnership with Spotify&rsquo;s Anchor</a> podcast creation platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquisition announcements often include assurances of no changes for current customers but Automattic&rsquo;s post made no promises and did not share many details regarding its plans for Pocket Casts. Integration with WordPress.com may be on the horizon but it&rsquo;s currently in the exploration stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As part of Automattic, Pocket Casts will continue to provide you with the features needed to enjoy your favorite podcasts (or find something new),&rdquo; Automattic&rsquo;s Head of Apps Eli Budelli said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will explore building deep integrations with WordPress.com and Pocket Casts, making it easier to distribute and listen to podcasts. We&rsquo;re thrilled that we can continue to give our users a multitude of ways to tell and engage with stories that matter.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 22:39:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Google Concludes FLoC Origin Trial, Does Not Intend to Share Feedback from Participants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119872\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:237:\"https://wptavern.com/google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6127:\"<p>Google quietly concluded its <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/floc\">FLoC</a> (Federated Learning of Cohorts) origin trial this week. The trial was part of Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/\">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative, a suite of new technologies designed to replace third-party cookies, fingerprinting, and other commonly-used tracking mechanisms. This particular experiment groups people together based on browsing habits and labels them using machine learning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>FLoC&rsquo;s trial was scheduled to end Jul 13, 2021, and Google has decided to remove the project from the testing phase while analyzing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided not to extend this initial Origin Trial,&rdquo; Google senior software engineer Josh Karlin said in <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/MmijXrmwrJs/m/f0Nc6h-KAQAJ\">thread</a> on Chromium&rsquo;s Blink Developers group forum. &ldquo;Instead, we&rsquo;re hard at work on improving FLoC to incorporate the feedback we&rsquo;ve heard from the community before advancing to further ecosystem testing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controversial experiment has been met with opposition from privacy advocates like makers of the <a href=\"https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/\">Brave</a> browser and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea\">EFF</a> who do not perceive FLoC to be a compelling alternative to the surveillance business model currently used by the advertising industry. Amazon, GitHub, Firefox, Vivaldi, Drupal, Joomla, DuckDuckGo, and other major tech companies and open source projects have already opted to block FLoC by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Twitter has been the first major online platform that <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/07/05/twitter-appears-to-be-on-board-with-googles-floc-initiative/\">appears to be on board with FLoC</a> after references to it were recently discovered in the app&rsquo;s source code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s initial efforts in presenting FLoC failed to gain broad support, which may have contributed to the company putting the brakes on its plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022. As the advertising industry yields to pressure from the last few years of privacy legislation, third-party cookies will be on their way out in what is colloquially known as the &ldquo;Cookie Apocalypse.&rdquo; Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">postponed</a> this milestone for Chrome to begin in mid-2023 and end in late 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to move at a responsible pace,&rdquo; Chrome Privacy Engineering Director Vinay Goel said. &ldquo;This will allow sufficient time for public discussion on the right solutions, continued engagement with regulators, and for publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services. This is important to avoid jeopardizing the business models of many web publishers which support freely available content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion on a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53069\">proposal for WordPress to block FLoC</a> has stalled in Trac but may have been premature in the first place if FLoC doesn&rsquo;t end making it to further testing. Proponents of blocking FLoC saw WordPress&rsquo; support or opposition as critical to the success or failure of FLoC adoption on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent article on the WordPress.com VIP blog titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://wpvip.com/2021/06/23/goodbye-third-party-cookies-hello-googles-floc/\">Goodbye, Third-Party Cookies, Hello Google&rsquo;s FloC,</a>&rdquo; indicates that Automattic may be straddling the fence on the controversial new technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>FLoC has its plus points. But it isn&rsquo;t as privacy-focused as we would like, and can lead to discriminatory practices, as described above. Then there&rsquo;s the concern of letting Google dominate yet another aspect of tech. Google also plans to charge any third-party tracking company for use of any of the data it has collected.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it looks like major tech platforms are off the hook for taking an active position on FLoC since it has been sent back for major modifications. In the most recently <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">updated timeline</a> for Privacy Sandbox milestones, Vinay Goel said Google received &ldquo;substantial feedback from the web community during the origin trial for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/\">first version</a>&nbsp;of FLoC.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the conclusion of its origin trial, FLoC seems far from ready for adoption, having failed to gain a foothold in the industry. The concern is that Google may ram FLoC through anyway using the weight of Chrome&rsquo;s market share, despite the web community&rsquo;s chilly reception. Although these proposed changes to ad tech will impact the entire industry, as well as regular internet users, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/08/google_floc_changes/\">Google does not intend to disclose any of the private feedback</a> the company received during FLoC&rsquo;s origin trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The main summary of that feedback will be the next version, and you can surmise based on what features (and the reasoning for these changes) are available in the next version,&rdquo; Google mathematician Michael Kleber said during a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1413096551359123457\">Web Commerce Interest Group (WCIG) meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Privacy advocates want to see more transparency incorporated into this process so that major concerns are not left unaddressed, instead of leaving it to stakeholders across the web to try to deduce what Google has solved in the next version of FLoC. Overhauling the advertising industry with new technologies should be done in the open if these changes are truly intended to protect people&rsquo;s privacy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 03:26:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Edupack Is Tackling Higher Ed With WordPress, Looking for Development Partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119928\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:219:\"https://wptavern.com/edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6721:\"<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically building the Jetpack for Higher Ed,&rdquo; said Blake Bertuccelli as he pitched me on the idea of <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/\">Edupack</a>, a project still in its early stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and his team are looking for more advisors to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">join the eighth round</a> of their once-monthly braintrust events. It is a project they began in November 2020, now coming to fruition. Feedback is crucial to pushing such undertakings out of the gate, and the team needs more of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli listed several focal points for the Edupack project:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> New campus users can set up a beautiful campus WordPress site with a few clicks.</li><li><strong>Archiving:</strong> Stale sites are automatically archived to save campus resources.</li><li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Accessibility, plagiarism, and resource usage can be accessed from the Edupack dashboard.</li><li><strong>Brand and Content Management:</strong> Approved Higher Ed content patterns and universal brand controls keep sites beautiful and consistent.</li><li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Cloud-controlled configuration settings means admins can control millions of sites from one place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Onboarding form with Tulane-branded elements.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our onboarding form offers pre-built sites for users to start from,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;So, if a scientist needs a new site for their lab, the scientist can select a pre-built lab site from our onboarding form then add in their unique content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli is Edupack&rsquo;s CEO. He called himself a &ldquo;forever learner&rdquo; and is currently reading <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em> by Bertrand Russell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I paid for my Tulane education by coding WordPress themes,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;After college, I founded one of New Orleans&rsquo; first WordPress dev shops (<a href=\"https://decubing.com/\">Decubing</a>). A year ago, I presented on building a self-publishing platform with Multisite at WP Campus. The feedback was phenomenal, and two blokes from Birmingham offered to work on a plugin with me. A few months later, we launched Edupack&rsquo;s MVP. Since then, folks from Harvard, Dartmouth, and about 17 other universities have been working with us to make WordPress an even better CMS for Higher Ed pros.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;two blokes&rdquo; he is referring to are his co-founders, Nathan Monk and Matt Lees. They run a WordPress shop called <a href=\"http://wearesmile.com/\">SMILE</a>. Monk is serving as Edupack&rsquo;s CTO. Lees is the Chief Creative Officer &mdash; Bertuccelli called him &ldquo;Lord of the UX.&rdquo; Altogether, the three co-founders have over 30 years of experience working with Higher Ed and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edupack team is making accessible content a priority, which is a primary issue for Higher Ed. The goal is to offer A11Y reports inside of the WordPress dashboard and tie them into publishing workflows. This would notify users of errors as they publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our accessibility reports tie into another feature we are launching this month: site archiving,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Campus users graduate and often forget about their sites. Edupack sends a notification to a user if the site hasn&rsquo;t been accessed, then adds an &ldquo;archived&rdquo; meta value to the site that super administrators can take action from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Setting up automated archiving.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Devs often recode thousands of sites to add new Campus branding,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli on the reasons behind Edupack. &ldquo;Department budgets are drained on resources for stale sites. Institutions are sued over inaccessible content or misused branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Edupack intends to automate website management so that Higher Ed pros can focus on supporting education.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following video is an introduction to Edupack:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join the Braintrust Session</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Every third Wednesday of each month, Edupack holds a &ldquo;Braintrust&rdquo; event. Bertuccelli says it is the best way to get involved. The session lasts for an hour over a Zoom video chat. The <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">next event is scheduled</a> for July 21, 10 am &ndash; 11 am (CDT).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each session focuses on a single question. Next week&rsquo;s question: &ldquo;How can we enhance WordPress blocks for Higher Ed?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll demo Edupack updates, brainstorm solutions for block enhancements, then wrap up with action steps for us to do by next month,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Folks who manage WordPress sites for global institutions and companies have attended our last seven braintrusts. Any Higher Ed pro is welcome!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested can also keep track of progress via the <a href=\"https://joinedupack.wordpress.com/\">Edupack blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is currently no publicly available pricing list. The project&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/frequently-asked-questions/\">FAQs page</a> says the team is still tuning the costs, and Bertuccelli remained quiet on any hard numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Community colleges can&rsquo;t afford tech used by bigger schools,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. Edupack will be priced so that every institution can afford the service. We haven&rsquo;t thought about pricing beyond that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities that wish to get check out the project should schedule a demo from the site&rsquo;s homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edupack has around 20 institutions serving as development partners and guiding <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/joinedupack/projects/2\">the roadmap</a>.

With so many enhancements headed our way, even we have not been able to keep up with them all here at WP Tavern. The next release will bring a few much-needed media-related upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should enjoy WebP image format support and a copy-to-clipboard button on the media upload screen. Developers have a new hook for filtering the image output format, and the platform is dropping infinite scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is scheduled to ship on July 20, so these changes will be landing in less than a week. If you have not already done so, give <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-3/\">WordPress 5.8 Release Candidate 3</a> a test run and report any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Infinite Scroll Replaced With Ajax Button</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Media Library screen (first) and overlay (second) with &ldquo;load more&rdquo; buttons. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The upcoming core release will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50105\">drop infinite scrolling</a> for media in favor of an Ajax-powered &ldquo;Load more&rdquo; button. The admin screen and editor&rsquo;s media overlay will cap the initial and subsequent &ldquo;pages&rdquo; to 40 media items each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change is a part of an effort from the WordPress accessibility team to improve the experience for end-users. Team member and core contributor Andrea Fercia noted <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40330\">two a11y problems with infinite scrolling</a>. The first is that it is impossible or nearly for keyboard users to reach content appended to the screen. Second, there is no audible feedback or instructions about how infinite scrolling works for screen readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted usability and performance issues. Infinite scroll can break the browser&rsquo;s history, and there is no JavaScript fallback. And loading hundreds or more large-sized images increases the memory footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the media library is getting the Ajax treatment in WordPress 5.8, we should expect similar updates for other areas in the future, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add Themes Screen</li><li>Customizer &gt; Add Menu Items</li><li>Editor &gt; Link &gt; Search</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy URL From Add New Media Screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Copy URL to clipboard button on the Add New Media screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This change is an enhancement that rids the platform of a small but noticeable nuisance that has plagued it for years. When uploading an image from the Media &gt; Add New screen in the WordPress admin, there was no way to grab its URL without clicking over to the edit screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 introduces a &ldquo;Copy URL to clipboard&rdquo; button that appears after the image has been uploaded. No need to leave the page and track down the URL. The change also makes the user experience consistent with the Media Library screen and overlay in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, browsing Trac means seeing many of the same names. This time around, it seems that a regular user wanted a feature. They created an account &mdash; perhaps for this purpose alone &ndash;, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/add-a-copy-link-button-at-the-media-upload-page/\">wrote a support forum post</a>, was directed to Trac, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51754\">created their first ticket</a>. It took eight months to work its way into WordPress, but it is one of those success stories of an average user making things happen by just providing feedback. Thanks for the contribution, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/anotia/\">@anotia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WebP Image Format Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress is allowing a new image format. And, no, it is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251\">not SVG</a> (technically not an image). There are still security hurdles to jump for that to ever happen. However, it now supports WebP, which carries with it the promise of better performance for those who use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sarah Gooding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">reported for WP Tavern</a> last month:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This modern image file format was created by Google in September 2010, and is now supported by 95% of the web browsers in use worldwide. It has distinct advantages over more commonly used formats, providing both lossless and lossy compression that is 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs and 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the report, she noted that only 1.6% (<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/im-webp\">currently at 1.8%</a>) of the top 10 million websites used the WebP format. With WordPress now adding support, that percentage is likely to rise in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers: Image Editor Output Format Hook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For developers who want to transform images with one mime type to another, 5.8 introduces the <code>image_editor_output_format</code> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52867\">filter hook</a>. Plugin authors can convert all newly uploaded images or only overwrite specific formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example converts JPG images to the new WebP format:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_filter( \'image_editor_output_format\', function( $formats ) {\n        $formats[\'image/jpeg\'] = \'image/webp\';\n\n        return $formats;\n} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The output format will be applied to all image sub-sizes as they are created. However, this will only work for WebP images if the webserver supports it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 03:09:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Patches Critical Vulnerability, Sending Forced Security Update from WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=120008\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3619:\"<p>WooCommerce has <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2564657/\">patched</a> an unspecified, critical vulnerability identified on July 13, 2021, by a security researcher through Automattic&rsquo;s HackerOne security program. The vulnerability impacts versions 3.3 to 5.5 of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://woocommerce.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2c1434dc56f9506bf3c3ecd21&id=8ff0a5345f&e=0110b26bc5\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> plugin, as well as version 2.5 to 5.5 of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> feature plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Upon learning about the issue, our team immediately conducted a thorough investigation, audited all related codebases, and created a patch fix for every impacted version (90+ releases) which was deployed automatically to vulnerable stores,&rdquo; WooCommerce Head of Engineering Beau Lebens said in the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/\">security announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org is currently pushing out forced automatic updates to vulnerable stores, a practice that is rarely employed to mitigate potentially severe security issues impacting a large number of sites. Even with the automatic update, WooCommerce merchants are encouraged to check that their stores are running the latest version (5.5.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WooCommerce backported this security fix to every release branch back to 3.3, store owners using older versions of WooCommerce can safely update to the highest number in their current release branch even if not running the very latest 5.5.1 version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of publishing, only 7.2% of WooCommerce installations are using version 5.5+. More than half of stores (51.7%) are running on a version older than 5.1. WordPress.org doesn&rsquo;t offer a more specific breakdown of the older versions, but it&rsquo;s safe to say without these backported security fixes, the majority of WooCommerce installs might be left vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The security announcement indicates that WooCommerce cannot yet confirm that this vulnerability has not been exploited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Our investigation into this vulnerability and whether data has been compromised is ongoing. We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to investigate this security vulnerability on their site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready. If a store was affected, the exposed information will be specific to what that site is storing but could include order, customer, and administrative information.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are concerned about possible exploitation, the WooCommerce team is <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/#comment-19937832\">recommending merchants update their passwords</a> after installing the patched version as a cautionary measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news for WooCommerce store owners is that this particular critical vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and patched within one day after it was identified. The plugin&rsquo;s team has committed to being transparent about the security issue. In addition to publishing an announcement on the plugin&rsquo;s blog, WooCommerce also emailed everyone who has opted into their mailing list.

I&rsquo;ve been in the open source space, wow, for almost 20 years, I&rsquo;m feeling old and actually got my raising on open source with the Joomla project, which is a hundred percent volunteer, open source content management system as well, and picked up WordPress slowly got into there. And boy, that&rsquo;s a lot of ands.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I love the community. I love the greater goal. That open source, espouses and tries to reach. And we&rsquo;re never, always successful. But having code and information more freely accessible is something I really believe in. And I think empowers people globally and provides opportunities that wouldn&rsquo;t happen if these ones and zeros were siloed away in golden towers. I&rsquo;m always just so tickled to talk about open source and all the interesting things we can do with it. It powers communities, it powers, politics, powers, freedoms, it powers companies. It&rsquo;s really amazing. And we talk about WordPress all the time as one of the defining tools in this space. You look at something like Linux, which pretty much literally everything uses these days. It&rsquo;s crazy how, to use Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s, favorite phrase, these things democratize all of us in so many different ways.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:05:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;ve got a really broad pallet of things that we&rsquo;re going to discuss today, ranging from Gutenberg, right through to WordCamps and all sorts. So we&rsquo;ll crack on with the smorgasbord of what we&rsquo;ve got to discuss. The first of our little laundry list is Gutenberg. You wanted to talk to us a bit today about Gutenberg, what you think of it, and so on. There was an event that I attended recently, which you were also in attendance at, and you were on a panel there, and you mentioned that in the face of proprietary page builders, you always had the approach that Gutenberg should be the first relation. It should come first. And I&rsquo;m curious to know, what did you mean by that? What is Gutenberg first? What is this approach?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:06:17]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So Gutenberg first to me is that we recognize the benefits of Gutenberg, and don&rsquo;t try to subvert them or sneak around them. I think Gutenberg is one of the most critical backend, frontend changes that has happened to WordPress in its last umpteen years and the potential for all the interesting future forward things that Gutenberg can do should be taken into account. So page builders are wonderful. They offer all this functionality, ease of use, but I think that, they should also take and utilize Gutenberg concurrently.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The advantages are, one, that Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. So God bless all the classic editor folk who loved that experience. More than just being deprecated, it&rsquo;s just, that is not going to be the way of the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And secondly, the potential, what can happen when you start making all that content a bit more atomic. I come from a lot of database work. So you think of atomic data points and Gutenberg does that sort of automagically for you? So there are opportunities in the future with Gutenberg to start parcing that data more finely.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s very exciting and why everything should be Gutenberg first. Again, that doesn&rsquo;t mean get rid of page builders or different types of themes and theming systems. It&rsquo;s just that at the base, Gutenberg should be a core building block of what you&rsquo;re working with going forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:07:51]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The way that I think many people are using Gutenberg at the moment, I should probably say the block editor, but if you&rsquo;re using the Gutenberg plugin, you&rsquo;ll obviously have an enhanced experience. But if you&rsquo;re using the block editor at the moment, it feels as if it&rsquo;s prime time for editing text, inserting images and some pretty basic stuff like that. But I can see on the horizon a whole plethora of interesting, curious, let&rsquo;s call them plug-ins for now, because that&rsquo;s what they are. Different block components, different plugins, which adapt and amend the capability of Gutenberg. And it feels to me as if that&rsquo;s where its strength might lie. I know we&rsquo;ve got the full site editing and all of that coming down the road, but it feels to me that, there&rsquo;s going to be a whole plethora of third-party tools, bringing all sorts of added benefits into the ecosystem, a block for this thing, and a block for that thing. And whilst that might create some kind of bloat, that to me is an exciting area, and I just wondered if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in, if there&rsquo;s any plugins or blocks that you&rsquo;ve been looking at and thinking, oh, that&rsquo;s curious. That seems to be stretching things a little bit.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:08:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, you make a, first of all, great point that there&rsquo;s block editor and then Gutenberg platform as a whole, and what end users typically experience is the block editor, but the Gutenberg API, Gutenberg platform as a whole is going to allow for all sorts of crazy third party integrations. That&rsquo;s great. And it might even be a little, you said the perfect word, there might be a bit of bloat and craziness. I&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;ll probably exist for the next 12 to 24 months. Sure, that&rsquo;s fine. As people figure out what works and doesn&rsquo;t. This is a dawn of a new age around taking WordPress to the next step. We&rsquo;ve talked about for many years, WordPress is just a blog, blah, blah, blah. Okay. We&rsquo;ve gotten past WordPress as a blog. Now WordPress as a CMS. That&rsquo;s great. I think what happens with Gutenberg is we look at it and say, WordPress is an application platform, and this is just another API that we can take advantage of in very different ways. So we can have forums that are much more catered to content creators, that get rid of all the WordPress backend and admin stuff. Okay, you&rsquo;re authenticated. You&rsquo;re logged in. Here&rsquo;s your daily news forum that you&rsquo;re going to add content to. And because we&rsquo;re using Gutenberg, that makes it a lot easier to publish that content and gets rid of the technical cruft, and allows developers and third-party plugin providers to have wholly unique and valuable experiences around that. And that&rsquo;s where the magic I think of Gutenberg really comes into play is where will all these third parties start finding those unique value propositions for specific content, whether it&rsquo;s an, a vertical, like travel or e-commerce, in a generic sense or news or publications or whatnot. It&rsquo;s really expanded the opportunities to create workflows and interfaces and make content production speedier and safer.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:10:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the curious things that I&rsquo;ve observed over the last couple of years about it is that perhaps if we had the magic rewind button, we could go back a couple of years and potentially not really get into a conversation where it was&hellip; okay, we&rsquo;ve got stage 1, 2, 3, and 4, and stages two, three, and four, start to add in functionality that things like page builders, can currently do, full site editing and all that. If it had just been touted as, we&rsquo;ve got a new editor for you, here it is, I think it would have taken people along for the ride much more easily, but we&rsquo;ve got this problem now, this impasse where, it got sold as it&rsquo;s going to become a page builder, but the pace of development and the fact that they&rsquo;ve got the legacy of 40 percent of the web, 40 plus percent of the web, to protect and so on it hasn&rsquo;t been able to move in that direction potentially at the speed that people thought&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s going to be a page builder. It hasn&rsquo;t been able to mature at the rate that they would have liked to have done. And so I&rsquo;m just curious in the next year, two years, whether it will do those things, but also I wish we could rewind and say look, slow down. Let&rsquo;s get the editor experience sussed out first, then we&rsquo;ll do the full site editing and don&rsquo;t expect it to be all these things. Beause at the minute I hear a lot of people saying it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over here, and it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over there. Speaking of which do you think there&rsquo;s a case where it isn&rsquo;t the best tool where you would say actually, do you know what, I&rsquo;m just going to relegate that and not use it first. Or is it literally, always the first thing in your toolkit for WordPress?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:12:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It is literally the first thing in my toolkit, because it will provide the greatest longevity in whatever&rsquo;s built. Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. There was a massive commitment to it from the project side of the universe. And to answer one of your earlier questions about, has it done enough? I think it&rsquo;s exceeded all expectations and this is where I&rsquo;ll get to it. They&rsquo;re always going to be a voices like, okay, it doesn&rsquo;t make bacon and eggs for me in the morning. Okay, That&rsquo;s fine, it doesn&rsquo;t. I think, and I truly believe what the magic of Gutenberg is, is the paradigm shift in forcing people to look at other things. So it&rsquo;s hard to make a giant feature change in anything, whether it&rsquo;s proprietary project, open source project. There are going to be plenty of people who are like, no, this works for me. This is great. Please don&rsquo;t change. I get that. But technology moves forward. People&rsquo;s expectations increase. Ten years ago, we barely had iPhones. All of a sudden we do, and now we expect everything to be infinitely easier and simpler and more responsive. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t do everything that page builders do. That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re not trying to cut out the middle man here, and I say we, I&rsquo;m not actually involved directly in Gutenberg at any point, but it moves the technological user experience goal posts forward. All things being equal, the page builders of the world, Beaver Builder, Elementor, they&rsquo;re all going to go their own way. Having Gutenberg as a critical component, soon enough, it will be just a mandatory component, that&rsquo;s the end of the conversation. Says, listen, everyone, this is what we need as part of the ecosystem. This is how you&rsquo;re going to connect with tools. You can absolutely go around those, but why would you want to, because this will be supported by a worldwide community.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s not just going to be supported by the Beaver Builder community or the Elementor community, yada yada, this is now the new core and that&rsquo;s very difficult to do, and it&rsquo;s not, jumping back to what I said earlier about it, I think just making that change in and of itself and committing to that change is more important than full site editor or anything else. There&rsquo;ll be incremental steps, but that was the big milestone step. Wow. Okay. This is the new tech, and we&rsquo;re going to have to take advantage of it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:14:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You said two words in that last little bit, well you certainly said paradigm shift and you said atomic. And I think for me, the atomic bit is really interesting because what I think many people haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get to grips with is literally the atomic nature of it. This little section of your blog post or whatever it may be. You can just have this little interactive thing. It might be that you&rsquo;ve got a block which does, I don&rsquo;t know, lead generation, or you&rsquo;ve got a block, like the cover block, which will just take care of the top of your posts. And each one of those things will have a different array of settings and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be built inside a proprietary thing. It&rsquo;s being built inside of the default editor for WordPress. So it&rsquo;s going to bring a ton of functionality and a ton of interesting things. Some of it will be bloated. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many people who fall into the trap of installing fifty times more than they need to, or five times more than they need to. But for those of us who were curious and check things out and look and see what the end result is, you&rsquo;re going to be able to create really unique experiences on this one surface, and that to me is really exciting, but have the feeling that the community got left behind in the conversation about this a little bit. So the confusion that it was going to be a page builder leads me to the whole community conversation. I know you&rsquo;re all about community. This is something that you thrive on. You love the WordPress community, as you have had loved many other communities in the past. Do you have any feelings around whether there&rsquo;s been enough involvement. Asking the questions, what should it look like? How should it behave? What do we want to leave on the floor and edit out that we just, it was a blind alley, we shouldn&rsquo;t have had that because there are some things that I think a really excellent, there are some things that I think I&rsquo;m not sure anybody&rsquo;s actually going to make use of that, but there it is. And just wondering what your thoughts were around, whether the community had been involved, whether it could have been involved more.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:16:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m getting chuckles about a lot of these things. Could there have been more all the editing and whatnot. Since community is, especially in WordPress, a huge word, it&rsquo;s always difficult to get every stakeholder, give them the space, give them the time given the vote.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What I like about what happened with Gutenberg is that it did move, in my mind, relatively quickly, and expeditiously and said, this is what we&rsquo;re doing. And I think it&rsquo;s too easy to be bogged down in the politics of community to actually get stuff done. So if things fall to the wayside, if things were not edit out properly, that&rsquo;s where I think, the greater ecosystem can come into play and say, we&rsquo;re going to tweak this, with a plugin that makes this just a bit better. It takes this out and we have such a robust economy in WordPress. That yeah, go for it. I like to see a bit more activism from people as a whole on these projects, but it&rsquo;s hard. We all have day jobs. We all have stuff to do, and I&rsquo;m not going to blame the leaders of the project for trying to get stuff done. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to give them kudos to just doing it because it&rsquo;s very easy to get pulled back and say you didn&rsquo;t listen to so and so, at some point we have to fish or cut bait, we need to do something and we need to move the technology forward because everyone else is doing it. And open source projects have a tendency, especially at their, let&rsquo;s say late teens, early adult stages, getting sucked into managing the community more than managing the project and pushing it forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You have to do both. It&rsquo;s such a tricky balance. All kudos to everyone at Make dot WordPress, that they were able to do this. And it&rsquo;s a large scale change and get it done. Fine, if you want to complain, that&rsquo;s great. Guess what? No software lives, at that moment in time, it&rsquo;s always updated and tweaked and there are still opportunities to make changes, advocate or different functionality. Expand the API, shrink the API, all those kinds of things. I do love that WordPress was able to cut bait and just go with it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:18:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>One of the underpinnings of WordPress since the inception really was PHP. And obviously now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where these technologies are being inspected, and improvements have been created along the way. And so now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where other technologies, for example, React is coming along and that requires quite a bit of relearning, you&rsquo;ve really got to down tools, get the manuals out, start to read again. Do you have any concern that that kind of thing could be a bit of a roadblock? It will be a bit of have a roadblock for certain people, but the technology has to move forward. Just curious as to what your thoughts are about how that&rsquo;s being implemented and whether or not we&rsquo;re taking it at a slow enough pace or whether we should have just stuck with good old PHP?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:19:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I like to use the right tool for the right projects, And I&rsquo;ve been a coder, developer, engineer in multiple languages. I&rsquo;ve actually never done anything with React, that&rsquo;s one of the first ones. And that&rsquo;s okay. We evolve. If we hadn&rsquo;t evolved all these still using C from 1969 or whenever it came out. So this stuff has to move forward. And if React is the best solution to do that on the front end, that&rsquo;s great.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Some people will be excited by that. Okay. I can expand my personal knowledge and horizons by adding to React. Honestly, a lot of the headless stuff that we see these days is also React. So it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to learn if you want to learn that. If you don&rsquo;t want to learn it. Okay, that&rsquo;s fine. There are plenty of opportunities to still expand your WordPress activities solely with PHP. Okay. Those are more personal choices. Do I want to learn another language? Do I want to improve on what I already have? Yes. Those are choices you have to make, but none of this lives in isolation. So we have to understand that a WordPress, plain old PHP site, might still need to connect up to a bunch of different things and not all those things are going to be on PHP. You still might be connecting up to something with Perl or Python. No, one&rsquo;s forcing you to learn it. Granted Gutenberg injects this react universe into your face, but you can focus on the core things that you need to do without necessarily running into React. It&rsquo;s a tool that more people are&hellip; here&rsquo;s the trick, there are plenty of new people who are entering coding, development, open source communities, and they like React. So it makes sense to take advantage of all this new found wealth, and then also draw them back into the community. Great, you love running with all this JS stuff. Fantastic. Hey, by the way, did you know you could actually implement that as part and parcel with an old-school PHP content management system? Yeah, we can do that. That&rsquo;s great. And look how you can expand your horizon. Yeah, it stinks if you don&rsquo;t want to learn any kind of Node, React stuff. Okay. But, it&rsquo;s sort of the nature of code. If we really want to take the analogy to the extreme, why aren&rsquo;t we still coding on punch cards with ones and zeros. We&rsquo;re going to abstract it and find the best tool to implement the functionality we want to see.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And I get it me personally, I&rsquo;m not going to go out and learn React today. Me twenty years ago, though, I would have added it into my tool belt in a heartbeat, just because it was just one of those things that you needed at that time, that was the case. People are going to go through their own personal and professional sort of life cycles of what they think they need to have on their knee or in their tool belt to be successful. We can&rsquo;t stop for people who don&rsquo;t want to do anything outside of PHP.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:22:04]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;re going to shift gears now and talk about in-person events. Under the auspices of things like WordCamp Europe, which is depending on when you&rsquo;re listening to this podcast that may just have happened, or it may be it&rsquo;s coming around in a year&rsquo;s time or something like that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Clearly we&rsquo;ve been through a period that has really shaken the community. I feel that as a community, we were probably as well-prepared as any community could be because we were already working via the internet. We all had our computers out and so on. And yet still there is a concern. And I know that for example, people like Josepha Haden Chomposy has mentioned things like this, that the community in the absence of in-person events, there&rsquo;s been a modest disengagement. And what I mean by that, this is the project, the WordPress project was propelled forward in a large part by those in-person events. So you&rsquo;ve got contrib day, you&rsquo;ve just got the handshaking, you can actually meet people for the first time. You can build relationships and so on. And none of that&rsquo;s happened. We&rsquo;ve had a year out. We don&rsquo;t know quite when that is coming back, hopefully at some point in the near future, but we don&rsquo;t know. And so just curious about your thoughts on that. What do you have to say about events coming back and how a project as big as WordPress, where there&rsquo;s no central office where there&rsquo;s no boss telling everybody what to do. So if you&rsquo;re on the payroll, you&rsquo;ve got to do this today and fix this thing, but that&rsquo;s not how it works. And so the open source model, there may be a chink in its armor here where in-person events don&rsquo;t happen, that camaraderie and those solutions don&rsquo;t present themselves. And so the project, I&rsquo;m going to use the word stalls, that&rsquo;s a complete over-exaggeration, but bits of the project stalled because nobody&rsquo;s meeting up.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:23:49]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I am a huge, huge advocate of in-person anything. Whether you&rsquo;re extrovert or introvert, there&rsquo;s always going to be someone that you really want to talk to sit down in a corner, or have a cup of coffee with and build that relationship. I&rsquo;m no anthropologist or anything, but feel that those kinds of human connections help us grow stronger in light of all the mundane things we do day to day. I don&rsquo;t think the project has suffered because of a lack of in-person events over the last year. I think it&rsquo;s suffered because everyone else has had a lot on their mind and there&rsquo;ll be a, certainly a renaissance of activity as soon as we get into in person but this is one of those things where I don&rsquo;t think correlation and causation match up. If you are worried about friends and family getting ill, did the economy, my personal economies take a downturn. That&rsquo;s going to weigh a lot more on someone than, oh, did I catch up on the latest WordPress dot org, Slack notification about Full Site Editing. So I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re completely tied together, but I will certainly tell you that as those in-person meetups start ramping up, I think that&rsquo;ll be a flurry of excitement and activity. Part of that will be just because we&rsquo;re not still trapped in our tiny little Covid bubbles.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:25:12]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What personally do you miss from the in-person events? You mentioned about having a coffee and sitting in a corner with somebody and so on, but anything that you find you&rsquo;re missing, it could be something quite banal or it could be something a lot deeper.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:25:24]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s really the accidents that happen at in person events. With a completely regimented online experience, I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking with Nathan at such and such time. I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking to whoever everything&rsquo;s organized, calendars. Okay, there&rsquo;s digital here, digital there. We may edit ourselves more on these platforms. When you&rsquo;re in-person accidents happen. We may be walking through the sponsor hall and accidentally bump shoulders. And it&rsquo;s oh my goodness, Nathan, great to see you. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in 14 months. This is amazing. And you just start a conversation and those kinds of conversations are organic and random and not necessarily so overly planned and well thought out. And at those moments, I think unique ideas, exciting things can happen that just don&rsquo;t happen in a much more shrunken space. I love the distributed world. And to your point, I think WordPress is not only just gone through well, it&rsquo;s actually succeeded because we&rsquo;ve already been in that position. We&rsquo;re already ready to be online and take care of the day to day.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We need those accidental bumpings of atoms to create new kinds of alloys. Oh my goodness. carbon and oxygen linked together. Oh, no, look what happened here. I don&rsquo;t know what they do, I&rsquo;m not a chemist! But my point being is when you&rsquo;re in person and I&rsquo;m going to keep calling them accidents, but not like in a pejorative kind of way, accidents happen, and it allows for very random, unique ideas, conversations, thoughts, whatever to happen, or just even a personal pick me up. Like you do remember me from being on slack for the last year. That&rsquo;s fantastic. There&rsquo;s an affirmation I think that happens for all of us when we&rsquo;re in that kind of proximity with other like-minded people.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:27:21]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the, there&rsquo;s two points about the online events that I seem to keep coming back to. And the first one is that I feel it&rsquo;s taught us that we ought to have hybrid going forward. What I mean by that is that WordCamp EU, I feel it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to put the genie back in the box of you have to go to the place where the event is. I feel that the future is going to be, sure enough, if you want to turn up and you want to benefit from the hallway and all of those things, go for it. But also if you&rsquo;re living halfway around the world, that now needs to be a door which is not closed to you, you need to have it open. There needs to be streaming of those talks that are happening each day so that everybody can take part. That&rsquo;s one of the things that I feel is going to happen.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:28:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I completely agree. There are events that I would have never been able to attend on a very regular basis without there being an online component. Someone will solve this puzzle, but I think it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to do a online and in-person event concurrently. I feel that you&rsquo;ll get the worst of both worlds in that case. What I&rsquo;d like to see, let&rsquo;s take WordCamp Europe 2022. There&rsquo;s going to be a three, four day in person spectacle. That&rsquo;s fantastic. What I would like to see is maybe two days before the in-person starts. There&rsquo;s a whole online portion of that. I&rsquo;d be concerned about trying to do them concurrently. Are we really going to have, we can do all the live video for example, but how interactive can we make those live portions? Oh, look from online, we have a question to the speakers. Okay. That works. But outside of those sessions, how are we going to integrate the sponsor hall, the hallway track as we talk about it? Those are those accidents that I like to refer back to just walking up and down and bumping into each other. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an easy problem to solve, but I&rsquo;d love to see some kind of greater online kickoff onboarding experience, where you can meet the speakers, do some quick Q and A&rsquo;s, and conversely, have the speakers say, make sure you don&rsquo;t miss my session on such and such date and time, then that will, of course be also livestreamed.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s going to be expensive. It&rsquo;s going to be complicated. And I think there&rsquo;s going to be multiple variations of attempts at making that succeed. I like to go with baby steps to see results. And I think just starting out with maybe a one or two day virtual camp tied to the in-person camp would be a good starter.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:29:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s what I was meaning really is just basically a camera at the back of the room where there&rsquo;s a presentation going on with the possibility of questions coming, not just from the audience, sat in the auditorium, but from people in a different part of the world. And in fact, I feel it in a way, these kind of like skeuomorphic pieces of software, which tries to replicate the real world, you&rsquo;ve got these AI representations of the hall. It&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s a bit of fun. I feel it&rsquo;s a dead end. Nobody ought to be under the illusion that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to do. But I do like the idea of just, here&rsquo;s the talk, you can watch it at the same time as everybody else. And then maybe you and your pals can hang out. You can do your bit online and we can do our bit in the real world, and so it goes. It&rsquo;s really just an opening up so that you don&rsquo;t have to attend because the problem there would be that nobody actually makes the attempt to attend, but I don&rsquo;t feel that&rsquo;s the case. And my second point is that I feel that we need this stuff back just because the online stuff, there&rsquo;s a fatigue associated with that, and I don&rsquo;t for a minute think that everybody&rsquo;s fatigued and I don&rsquo;t for a minute, think the online events don&rsquo;t have merit because they have enormous merit and they&rsquo;ve been an amazing bridge, but I feel that there&rsquo;s a proportion of the people who would love to be at live events who just can&rsquo;t make the transition to the virtual events. There&rsquo;s something about it. Something stifles them, perhaps they have the best will in the world, and then it&rsquo;s on the screen. But then something in the real world occurs to them. The cat decides to chew up the sofas, so off you go, you&rsquo;ve got to deal with the cat. You get distracted, you want to go and make a cup of tea, so you get distracted. Whereas if you&rsquo;re at the WordCamp, you&rsquo;re fully there. You&rsquo;ve engaged, you&rsquo;ve committed. You&rsquo;ve potentially got on a plane. You&rsquo;ve booked a hotel, all of that. And there&rsquo;s no substitute for that. So that really was my second point is that I want to get the people who&rsquo;ve been disengaged back in and ready to take on all of the challenges that we&rsquo;ve got.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:31:42]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. I think we&rsquo;re on the same page. I can do virtual events. I certainly prefer in person. And the best example of how we know that in-person is very valuable is when you go to a lot of these virtual events, the networking spaces are generally very empty. People aren&rsquo;t having those conversations, those random accidental conversations that they would add an in-person event because at an in-person event, you are physically, quote unquote, stuck in that space. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk to someone, you&rsquo;re just going to go your own way. That&rsquo;s great. But if you do, who knows who&rsquo;s next to you and you&rsquo;re going to overhear things and interrupt the conversation and be interrupted and that&rsquo;s that magic that occurs.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:32:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s talk about the third point that we wanted to discuss today. I&rsquo;m straying into an area where I don&rsquo;t have a great deal of experience because I watch these things happen from afar. There&rsquo;s nothing that really concerned me. That concerned me in the sense that I might be a consumer of some of the things that are being bought up. But you wanted to talk about, as you described it, the WordPress economy acquisition madness. Now, what did you mean by that? Just kick us off. Explain what you mean by that phrase.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:32:56]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Here&rsquo;s the beauty of being a successful project, people with money will find ways to make money from it. And that&rsquo;s okay, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;re seeing the likes of Automattic, WP Engine, GoDaddy, Liquid Web, Cloudways, yada, yada, yada. All these companies, wink wink, they&rsquo;re all hosting companies because they&rsquo;ve been in the space for awhile under different platforms and have recurring streams of revenue and cash on hand, they&rsquo;re going to look to grow their businesses, and one of the easiest ways is to find valuable niche projects, that not only will bring cool bit of code into what they&rsquo;re trying to do, but also allow them to reach out to all the people who have installed that plugin.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:33:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you have concern then that certain parts of the WordPress, let&rsquo;s say plugin or theme space, are going to be consumed by these bigger entities as you described? In many cases, there will be hosting companies for reasons you&rsquo;ve just explained. Do you have a feeling that silos in the future are going to occur? Where if you really want a decent, let&rsquo;s go for, I dunno, membership experience, you really are better off going in the direction of that company, with the brands that it&rsquo;s acquired over time. Or if you want to go for a WooCommerce experience, your best bet is going to be over here, and everything else is a poor relation of that. So we get silos, which we haven&rsquo;t had until now.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:34:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think that&rsquo;ll happen in the short term, but when that happens, a vacuum is created in the overall ecosystem. So if hosting company X has a, quote unquote, monopoly on that membership plugin, you know what, first of all, it&rsquo;s all open source. All it takes is company Y to be like, we want to be in that space as well, and we&rsquo;re going to re-imagine the underlying open source code base in XYZ format. Yes, a lot of letters there, but it&rsquo;ll happen. These kinds of acquisitions and changes in economy I feel are okay. We&rsquo;re all working from an open source code base. If this was all proprietary stuff that you can never take advantage of, I think that would be bad for the community as a whole, but that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s just one company saying we&rsquo;re going to be owners of this project. You can still fork that project any day of the week, don&rsquo;t forget. Cause it&rsquo;s all GPL. So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re losing anything in the long run. There&rsquo;ll be short term hiccups. People won&rsquo;t be happy. If that plugin doesn&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be happy even if it wasn&rsquo;t taken over by someone else. I think there&rsquo;s a percentage of people that will always want to see all this independent software, but all these companies are technically, okay maybe they&rsquo;re not all independent because some of them are actually listed on public exchanges, but the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been taken away, and if such and such plugin gets acquired by such and such hosting company, I certainly see another hosting company looking for that competitor also happening.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:36:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you feel that, okay, again, rewinding the clock for the second time in this podcast, if we could go back maybe 6, 7, 8 years, something like that, before these companies were buying up suites of plugins and what have you, to bulk out their offering. We basically had independent plugin developers. There may have been a team that grew up over time and they were inventing a solution for a particular problem, and they were really invested in that, and that was great. We want to solve the calendar thing or we want to solve the, I don&rsquo;t know, the menu thing, whatever it may be. I&rsquo;m just wondering if we&rsquo;re maybe getting into the territory of designing things to be acquired. We designed something so that this can happen, so that we can become bought up, taken along for the ride by a big hosting company, and just really whether or not there&rsquo;s any dynamic that changes the way that instead of serving the customer and always trying to offer the best support for the product, really your whole intention for that business isn&rsquo;t to create the product for the customer, it&rsquo;s to create the product for the sell in the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:37:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I agree. I think there&rsquo;s a potential for that. On the correlator, are you getting value in what you want out of that product? So if I use, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m going to jump into because it&rsquo;s happened recently, but on the face of it, it&rsquo;s a product that is so useful to me that I&rsquo;m not going to have to do custom code. It&rsquo;s above and beyond every other plugin competitor in that space. Am I going to use it? I&rsquo;m going to use it, yes. And to some degree it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the incentives for the developer are at that point. If it&rsquo;s doing what I wanted to do, that I&rsquo;m going to use it because that&rsquo;s what I needed to do, and it&rsquo;s going to save me 10 50, 200 hours of development time to use this plugin as opposed to trying to create something on my own. And that&rsquo;s question one, or the answer one. Answer two is there certainly is an issue with, what&rsquo;s a nice word for miscreant. I guess it&rsquo;s gonna be miscreant, where we&rsquo;ve seen recently some plugin developers literally switch out what that plugin does and what its value proposition is with, quote unquote, upgrades. And they&rsquo;ve done it behind your back. Oh, well you signed up for this cute little plugin that makes banners, guess what, now it&rsquo;s going to do all these things and you have to pay for it just to get banners again, and it&rsquo;s like really, really is that really what you want to do? And I think those developers are getting called out on it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The agencies and content creators, certainly in the nearby community are aware of that. I think those kinds of, yeah, they&rsquo;re not necessarily illegal in any way, shape or form because you can do that, but it doesn&rsquo;t really stick by the unofficial developer third party ecosystem code of conduct. And I think we&rsquo;re always going to see exceptions to the rule, but as long as those are just exceptions, I think we&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:38:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Let&rsquo;s pivot again. Openverse. I&rsquo;ve got to say, this is something that kind of passed me by. The radar wasn&rsquo;t working properly over the last few weeks since Openverse came along. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to tell us what Openverse is. I have a very vague understanding of what it is, but I&rsquo;d like you to tell us why you think it&rsquo;s important.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:39:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This is a new project in the WordPress ecosystem. I should say WordPress dot org ecosystem. It comes from creative commons search project that was languishing at creative commons. They didn&rsquo;t have community and developers interested in pushing the search component along and, with support from Automattic, it came into the welcoming arms of wordpress dot org. And it has it&rsquo;s own thing called Openverse. I&rsquo;m excited by it. One, because it expands the open source vision of WordPress, WordPress becoming even a greater open source proponent. It&rsquo;s not just the CMS, but now we also have additional things that we&rsquo;re caring about, which I think is fantastic. It simultaneously is going to be working on technical aspects as well as open libra software model, or content model, I should say, where the tool will be helping WordPress as well as anyone else, obviously on finding creative commons, open licensed media. So in this case, images. I think it&rsquo;s a great expansion that&rsquo;s completely in line with what the project is looking to do. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be surprisingly helpful and people won&rsquo;t even realize what&rsquo;s going on, but they&rsquo;ll all of a sudden be able to access a bunch of new content natively in whatever application, obviously WordPress will be at that top of the list, but, you&rsquo;ll be able to access it with Drupal or proprietary systems.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:40:40]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was the problem with the old licensing model? What was broken with it?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:40:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was broken was there was no one who was going to commit to keeping up the code base to make CC search working and functioning, tweaking it, bug fixes, whatnot. So, as part of the WordPress project, there will actually be active development and maintenance of the creative common search.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:41:02]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay, so was there any concern that things which you may have downloaded from third-party sites, we all know the ones that we customarily go to, that they were often perhaps changing the license after you downloaded things, and then suddenly you didn&rsquo;t realize that you were in contravention of a license, which you thought you had full access to download, redistribute, do whatever you wanted and suddenly you realize, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s no longer the case. This image that I&rsquo;ve got, I need to take down.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:41:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, licensing is so fun and entertaining. So a lot of these download an image sites, those licenses still stand. So if you have downloaded it and are using an image that was licensed under creative comments, that&rsquo;s not going away. Will they relicense new images? Possibly. The point is how easy will it be to find more creative commons based media? And I think that is the purpose of Openverse, to make that as easy and intuitive as possible. So again, it&rsquo;s taking what used to exist as part of creative, common search, almost like a fork, rebranding it under Openverse and, making it part of an ecosystem that&rsquo;s open source.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:42:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And this is going to be completely available inside the WP admin. So you&rsquo;ll have search integrated there, and if you want to search for, I don&rsquo;t know, a cat on cushions, for example, you&rsquo;ll be able to do that and everything that&rsquo;s returned, you&rsquo;ll be able to use, hopefully because the search will have returned something valuable to you in this case cat&rsquo;s on cushions.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:42:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So that is my expectation.

Because of this community I have overseas friends.\" /><p>I’m Gobinda Tarafdar from Dhaka, Bangladesh. In short, Gtarafdar. This short form is available everywhere on social media. Actually, while I was a kid, a medicine specialist suggested this short form of my name. From that time, I had a plan to use it. Moving on, now I have become a WordPress Enthusiast Marketer. In this essay, I will share my journey to WordPress with you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gtarafdar_winter_clothing.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>Early Stage Of My Career:</h3>\n<p>I started my career as a teacher in an academic coaching center back in 2010. I was then a 1st-year student of my 4-year Graduation Program. But the number of my earnings was not sufficient to cover all my livelihood. My parents were giving me support to continue my study at that time. So I was looking for more ways to earn my living. But in our country, it’s tough to get a job without graduation. I tried to find more tutoring jobs but failed to get one. Then I gave stand-up comedy a try. At that time, it became popular. I participated in a TV reality show based on stand-up comedy. But failed to reach the top five. So, didn’t get much success in the comedy sector as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gtafdar_standup_comedy.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In this way, two years passed. After a while, I got the idea of a call center job in the telco industry of our country. I gave an interview to our number one telco company Grameenphone &#8211; a sister concern of Telenor. And luckily got the chance to join there. And it’s a game-changing part of my career. I learned a lot about team play, pressure handling, the ability to put myself in a customer’s shoes, and more. But it was a part-time job, and my graduation was about to end. Immediately after finishing my graduation, I got the opportunity to join Grameenphone’s Finance team. However, I had to pass the challenging interview as many other promising candidates were competing with me. Everything seemed so great at that time. Got the opportunity to work in the country&#8217;s best corporate office, but bad luck struck again. Didn’t get the chance to be a full-time employee from contractual employee status.</p>\n<p>I took a break to join the country&#8217;s public service commission. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired position again. In the meantime, my father retired from his job. All of a sudden, so many responsibilities came upon me. By the way, I forgot to mention, in this time frame, I had completed my Graduation, Masters, and MBA. The year where I’m now in the beginning of 2018. After my father’s retirement, I had no time for an experiment. But the main challenge came then.</p>\n<blockquote><p>No one wanted to give me a chance as I worked at one of Bangladesh&#8217;s most prominent companies; they thought I couldn’t fit into their office culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also, I wanted to start my career as a Digital Marketer, and I had no practical experience at that time. I had some certification of Udemy and Hubspot free courses. But I was confident that I had a degree of MBA in Marketing. But all of my confidence was doomed within three months. I stopped applying everywhere, started to do some research on the job sector. Finally, I decided to join the IT industry, and in our country, WordPress Based companies are in the leading position. So, I had my target fixed towards the WordPress industry.</p>\n<h3>A Huge Risk-Taking State in My Career:</h3>\n<p>I took a huge risk to start my career in the WordPress industry. After not seeing much job opportunities in the Digital Marketing area in my country, I was planning to join the telco industry again as I was finding no option to cherish my dream. I badly needed a job at that time. But meanwhile, I found a job circular in weDevs. They were looking for a Digital Marketer Intern. So I made my decision to take part in this program. Surprisingly, I got another job offer from a renowned MNC of our country in the sales team. But I took a huge risk and started trying for the weDevs internship program, and refused the salesperson job. My friends <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrMayeen\">Mayeen</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AkhterArif\">Arif</a> helped me a lot to learn more about WordPress. And they guided me on how I could set up localhost on my computer, and from then, I started to explore themes and plugins from the WordPress repository. I must say I got an interesting tool to play with. After passing three stages, I finally got the chance to join weDevs. weDevs is a popular WordPress Plugin making company. It’s famous for Dokan Multivendor Marketplace Solution for WooCommerce.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_life_at_weDevs.jpg\"><img /></a>My Life at weDevs\n<p>Ohh, maybe you have a question about how it can be risky to go for the weDevs internship program! Well, the payout of the other company was three times higher than the weDevs internship payout. And I refused to join the other sales team while I still didn’t have any guarantee to join the weDevs team. So now you can judge, isn’t that risky? (Sorry, I can’t share the name of the sales company publicly here due to some policy issue.)</p>\n<h3>The Journey to WordPress:</h3>\n<p>From the day when I had installed WordPress in my local host, my journey in this ecosystem started. I found it so easy to use and user-friendly that I felt anyone could create a website. I started to read articles and explore the World of WordPress. Also, weDevs’s internship program helped me a lot to get involved in the WordPress industry. My mentor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AfshanaDiya\">Afshana Diya</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mainul0aion\">Mainul Kabir Aion</a> guided me a lot to dive deep into the sea of WordPress. Learned the area of content marketing, explored paid mediums, gathered knowledge on social media marketing, and more within three months. The internship program was exact and compact, along with interactive.</p>\n<p>Here came another twist. I wanted to be a part of the Digital Marketing Team. But because of my communication skills and interpersonal relationship skills, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nizam5428\">Mr. Nizam Uddin</a> (Founder &amp; CEO at weDevs) offered me the Business Development executive position. It was an entirely new thing at weDevs. I was the one-man army in the Business Development Team. And it opened up a new world to me. At that time, I got my first chance to attend a WordCamp (WCAhmedabad, India 2018). From that time, I got the motive to be involved in the WordPress Community. I’ll share how WordCamps can help you to join the community closely. Later on, I got the chance to participate in WordCamp Kolkata 2019, WordCamp Nagpur 2019. It was a fantastic journey to join WordCamps in person. In 2019 I took part in WordCamp Dhaka as a volunteer.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_WordCamps.jpg\"><img /></a>My Journey to WordCamps\n<p>I’d love to share with you; now, I have become part of the Digital Marketing Team of weDevs. After almost two years of my journey as a business development executive, I got this new opportunity to prove myself again. So I took this opportunity and became a Digital Strategist.</p>\n<p>Now I’m dedicatedly taking care of a sole product. It’s an Addon of Elementor Page Builder. It’s HappyAddons for Elementor. I’m the product coordinator of this excellent tool. From zero to now, 100k+ users are actively using this tool. It’s an incredible learning period in my career path. I learned how to grow a product from the ground level. It’s a great achievement for me as a Product Marketer.</p>\n<h3>How WordCamp Helps Me to Become a Member in the WordPress Community:</h3>\n<p>WordCamps are the place of like-minded people. When you are in touch with the right people under the same roof, you will get that homely feeling. Also, in WordCamps, you get to meet industry experts. Interestingly, you can collect lucrative swag items. To some extent, you will get an opportunity to make partnerships to expand the business. Moreover, some companies share job boxes where anyone can share their resume. So it could be a place of opportunities. Who knows what you will get. But in my case, I made so many friends. We are now close buddies.</p>\n<p>The exciting part, some WordCamps run contributors day. On that day, you will get the chance to know closely about how you can take part in the core programs of WordPress. From WordCamp Ahmedabad, I started participating in WordPress programs, also started joining WordPress teams meetings. I’ve become active on social media as well to spread news and updates related to WordPress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enriching\">How I’m Enriching My Knowledge of WordPress:</h3>\n<p>One line changes my way of thinking. Once I was talking with our Founder &amp; CTO, Mr. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tareq_cse\">Tareq Hasan</a>, regarding this topic. He just said, “Gobinda, you don’t have to learn coding to solve the problems of WordPress; you have to gain the ability to solve the problem by anyhow. You can solve any kind of problem by referring to other WordPress Plugins and tools.”</p>\n<p>I got a new meaning of using WordPress. From that time, I have started to check WordPress plugins and themes to learn more about their purpose. WordPress repository now becomes a place of amusement for me. Sometimes, my colleagues refer to me as a ‘plugin man’ as I try to give a quick solution to WordPress-related problems with the help of WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>Still, I’m participating in several Facebook Group discussions. Trying to solve several solutions and learning what problems are usually people facing while creating websites with WordPress. And believe me, there is definitely a solution to each particular problem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have to keep patience and search for the solution in the right type of keywords.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, yesterday on the Facebook group &#8211; WordPressian (Dedicated Facebook Group for those who speak Bangali), a person was looking to create a courier service platform where people can track their package. Most people suggested building a custom-made solution. But I know there is a solution; I randomly found it on the WP repository.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I just googled this term “WordPress plugin: courier service”. Google didn’t disappoint me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I got my answer, read the description, reviewed, checked screenshots, and shared the solution with that person.</p>\n<p>To increase my knowledge of WordPress, I use another method. I use some Google Chrome Extensions for checking the Builtwith Materials of WordPress sites. When I jump on a WordPress site, I just click on the Chrome Ext. and check the plugins they’ve used to create their site. And it helps me a lot to learn the tools and their purposes. You can do that if you want to increase your knowledge of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you have to create a site by yourself. Otherwise, you would not be able to know the issue on your own. At least create your own portfolio site. I have learned so many things while creating my portfolio site: gtarafdar.com. You will know some untold facts, and finally, you will get a boost. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/\">Mr. Asif Rahman</a>, the founder of WP Developers, gave me this idea. He always inspires me to create a personal website. Also, he forced me to write about WordPress daily. Guided me on how I can create a site with Elementor in 2018. I became familiar with a handy tool that helps me create a site without having coding experiences from that time. Later on, it helped me to take over the Happy Elementor Addons Project.</p>\n<h3>How you can connect with WordPress Socially:</h3>\n<p>Twitter is the best medium. I opened my Twitter account in 2010. But I had no motivation to use it as I didn’t have people close to me there. My friends were all on Facebook. I was also trying to involve myself on Facebook. But after joining weDevs, I found my Mentor, Afshana Diya, was so active on Twitter, and she has so many like-minded people on Twitter, and most of them belong to the WordPress community. I got new motivation to use Twitter. I started to connect with WordPress Professionals. Also interacted with them regularly. And I must say it feels really amazing.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1143525711489036288\"> list of WordPress Influencers</a>. You can easily follow them from here.</p>\n<h3>How you can start your career at WordPress:</h3>\n<p>If you have a passion for coding, you could be a WordPress developer. In our region, here is a myth. To become a developer, you have to be a CSE grad. But it’s not true. Let’s check a fact. In our weDevs, most of the Developers are directly not from Computer Science Engineering backgrounds. In the same way, you may have joined the CSE program at an early stage, but now you may not have that much passion for coding. You can be a Product Manager. In the WordPress industry, there is scope for a Product manager as well. Another exciting sector is the Quality Assurance team. So many companies are hiring in this sector. Moreover, if you like to communicate with people, you can join the Support Engineering team. You can’t imagine how many job openings there are in the support engineering field.</p>\n<p>Those who don’t have any coding knowledge but are proficient in English and have a passion for writing can join as Content Marketers. There are plenty of job vacancies in the content marketing area.</p>\n<p>Another interesting option is joining the Designing team. If you find interest in the designing sector and love to play with the designing tools like Figma, Adobe Tools, Sketch, you can definitely join the design team of a WordPress company.</p>\n<p>Later on, other job sectors like HR management, Accounts, Business Development, and other necessary areas are also available on WordPress companies. More interestingly, you can work remotely in so many companies. WordPress founding company Automattic is running its whole operation remotely. You just have to find your perfect niche. Otherwise, you can be frustrated.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a list of <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/wpjobs/popular-wordpress-companies-to-apply-for-jobs/\">WordPress companies</a> where you can apply for jobs.</p>\n<p>Finally, don’t be frustrated, my mate. I often hear from my fellow friends and juniors always blame God, parents, and the government because of their unemployment problem. But when I reach them and personally request to gain some technical skills, they just run away most of the time. Not even reply to my messages anymore. Even some of them block me. Lol. Also, some other groups are available; they knock me for jobs and share their family issues, but when I ask them to learn more about web development, they just fly like a bat. I don’t know what their problem is. If you are in the same category, then my mate, you are in huge trouble. Change your mindset. Gain some skills. It could be anything. Try one by one. Then choose the best one for you. But again, don’t be frustrated. Keep focusing on your goal. And dive into it.</p>\n<h3>What’s The Challenge on Working in WordPress Industry:</h3>\n<p>I’ve shared all the positive things about joining the WordPress industry. But there is a significant challenge you have to face while you will join the community. In my region, very few people know WordPress. Only tech-savvy people are familiar with that. Even most of the people don’t have any prior knowledge about remote job life. I have personally experienced so many funny incidents. Last year when my family members found me in front of my Mac and sometimes talking with some people, sometimes in English, they found me as an alien in my house. Even most of the time, I failed to give proof of how the whole work was done. You will face the same situation if you belong to the rural area of Bangladesh. But don’t worry, I prepared a comic book on <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/book/e-book-describe-wordpress-to-non-techies/\">Describe WordPress To Non-Techies</a>. You can read the conversation with my Grandpa. I have tried to give an idea about WordPress. I hope this will help you to introduce WordPress to the non-tech guys.</p>\n<h3>How I’m Contributing to the WordPress Community and how you can start:</h3>\n<p>Usually, I try to attend the weekly meeting of WordPress teams. I have attended several coffee-talk sessions of WordPress Teams. It helps me join with the members. Also, I’m trying to contribute to the Polyglot team. I have started to give suggestions of translating WordPress in Bangla. But mostly, I contribute in different ways. I have conducted local WordPress meet-ups, volunteered on WordCamps. I spread the news and updates through my social media accounts. Help WordPress people to find jobs. Recently, I’ve started my YouTube Channel(Gtarafdarr). I have begun to create how-to tutorials on WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you want to join WordPress core teams, you will need a WordPress Slack Account. From here, you can join WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>From here, you will find the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/\">meeting</a> schedules of different teams. Don’t get puzzled. You can sort out your desired teams and add the meeting reminders to your calendar.</p>\n<p>Everyone in the WordPress community is so helpful. If you find any difficulties, raise your hand and people will guide you in the right way.</p>\n<p>Also, there are so many WordPress Facebook communities. Some are locals, and few are international, like WordPress, Advanced WordPress, WordPress For Non-Techies by WPCrafter, The WP Admin Bar, WPLeague, WPBeginner Engage &#8211; WordPress Help for Non-Techies, etc. Local Communities are, WordPressians, Kolkata WordPress Community (WPKolkata), etc. You can join these groups to get help from experts. Also, you can help others if you know the answers of the queries.</p>\n<h3>This How WordPress Changed My Life</h3>\n<p>Finally, I’m really thankful to WordPress. Because of this community I have overseas friends. We talk and meet virtually. All of them are so helpful. I get new motivations to do something extraordinary in my daily routine. I’m thankful to my parents and my younger sister as they rely upon me. They help me to take the risk to chess my dream. I’m grateful to weDevs and Tareq Hasan, Nizam Uddin, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Asif2BD\">Asif Rahman</a>, Afshana Diya, Mainul Kabir Aion, and my friends Arif, Mayeen, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shahriar_na\">Shahriar</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reachmazharul\">Mazhar</a>, and so on. They all have played a significant role in helping me become Gtarafdar, a WordPress enthusiast. Also, thanks to the HeroPress team for reaching me and encouraging me to share my story here.</p>\n<p>I’m still learning about WordPress and have to go further. If you want to connect with me, you can follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gtarafdarr\">@Gtarafdarr</a>. Let’s contribute to WordPress and hold the glory of the supreme power of an open-source platform.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-has-changed-my-life-gtarafdar/\">How WordPress Has Changed My Life &#8211; Gtarafdar</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:42:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Gobinda Tarafdar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: InstaWP Launches New Service for Disposable WordPress Testing Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119740\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4526:\"<p>Competition in the sandboxing products space is heating with the entrance of <a href=\"https://instawp.io/\">InstaWP</a>, a new service for setting up disposable WordPress testing sites. Founder Vikas Singhal created the tool to provide a quick way to set up live testing sites online or to show something to a client or team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP joins the ranks of services like <a href=\"https://tastewp.com/\">TasteWP</a> and <a href=\"https://wpsandbox.io/\">WPSandbox</a> but with a few unique options. At setup, users can select from WordPress versions back to 4.7 and may even choose to spin up a site using the latest beta or release candidate. Like other services, InstaWP allows you to choose your PHP version. The ability to disable WP cache and browser cache is coming soon. Users can create a custom name for their sites or leave it blank for a randomly generated name.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Free WordPress instances stay live for 8 hours, and users can link their accounts via email to extend it to 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP, not to be confused with <a href=\"https://instantwp.com/\">InstantWP</a>, a local WordPress installation tool, was built on an nginx + Apache server without any containers. Singhal said he found containers to be too heavy for this particular use case. He runs a <a href=\"https://expresstech.io/\">WordPress plugin/theme shop</a> along with an&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justhyre.com/\">agency</a>&nbsp;on the side, both of which could benefit from InstaWP&rsquo;s quick testing sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to build a solution for ourselves where we can quickly launch WP instances for a variety of reasons &ndash; testing a feature of WP, testing a plugin/theme, testing in different versions of WP/PHP and last but not the least &ndash; creating an &lsquo;instant&rsquo; test environment for the clients for them to test our plugins/themes,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal started InstaWP a month ago and received so much positive feedback on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/o8cxwj/instawp_launch_a_disposable_wp_instantly_free/\">Reddit</a> and from the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/poststatus/453?e=de2e3e61f2\">Post Status community</a> that he hired two dedicated developers to work on the project. Testers have commented on how fast the service spins up sites. Version <a href=\"http://next.expresstech.io/instawp/updates/939abf2f-c532-4abc-b701-eec9f89b6fda\">1.1.0</a> introduced Slack integration, which allows users to instantly set up a site by typing /wp in Slack. The release also added WordPress admin auto login for quick access without username and password.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP has a <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp\">public road map</a>. Features on deck for future releases include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Slack and cli commands</li><li>Download Files and DB Backup from the UI</li><li>Direct push to FTP or cPanel</li><li>nginx and nginx + Apache configurations</li><li>Finer controls on PHP settings</li><li>Save configurations for instant launch of pre-configured WP</li><li>Integrations with hosting providers</li><li>Map custom domains</li><li>Multiple servers around the world (USA, Singapore, London, etc.)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said he was aware of TasteWP as a competitor but plans to differentiate InstaWP based on simplicity and feature set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My vision with InstaWP is make it a default tool for WP learners, enthusiasts, freelancers, and agencies &ndash; basically everyone,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal plans to monetize the tool for both end-users and plugin and theme authors. Users will have to upgrade to gain access to increased limits, custom domains, FTP access, and the ability to reserve a site. WordPress product authors can upgrade to provide 1-click demos to their clients and prospective customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said so far more than 500 instances have been created and teams from Yoast and some agencies are already using the tool. Several prominent WordPress businesses have requested agency pricing that would allow their users to test their plugins via a 1-click preconfigured install. The service is still under active development and Singhal plans to iron out pricing in the near future. Testers who have suggestions for InstaWP can log them on the tool&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp#/ideas\">idea board</a> for future consideration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 04:25:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Duotone Filters: WordPress 5.8 Puts a Powerful Image-Editing Tool Into Users’ Hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:227:\"https://wptavern.com/duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4769:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Features such as the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">block-based widgets system</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">the template editor</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\">theme-related blocks</a>, and others have taken up much of the spotlight as of late. However, one of the best user-focused tools shipping with WordPress 5.8 is a duotone filter for Image and Cover blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;duotone&rdquo; in this sense means combining two colors as a filter. Then, layering it over an image or video. More specifically, one color is used for the shadows (dark elements), and the second color is used for the highlights (light colors).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the feature first <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-6-adds-duotone-filters-query-pattern-carousel-and-most-used-tags-selector\">landed in Gutenberg 10.6</a> back in May, I spent a couple of hours just tinkering around with it on that first day. Since then, I have racked up a few more. It is a powerful media-editing tool that does not require users to dive into image-editing programs, allowing them to change the mood of a story at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotones can be anything from a simple grayscale to a mixture of any two colors. Shadows and highlights can even be inverted, depending on the shades chosen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following shows the difference between an original image of kittens (<em>because who doesn&rsquo;t love kittens?</em>) and one with a grayscale filter:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img id=\"119947\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" /><img id=\"119948\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-gray.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1793\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" /></div>Original image vs. grayscale duotone version.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers a set of eight duotone color sets by default. This includes a grayscale, dark grayscale, and various combinations, making for some fun filters. Some will work better than others, often depending on the media file uploaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Applying the WordPress purple and yellow duotone filter.\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other features awaiting users with WordPress 5.8, theme authors are those who need to dig in to offer a range of ready-baked options for users. The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-8-a-developer-centric-call-for-testing-theme-json-configuration\">theme JSON file configuration</a> allows developers to define a set of duotone colors that match their theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining custom duotone filters is as easy as plugging a name, a slug, and two colors into a <code>theme.json</code> file. The theme developer handbook includes <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">examples of creating such presets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom &ldquo;emerald scale&rdquo; duotone filter from a theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Users are not limited to the filters that WordPress or their themes offer. The duotone popover allows them to choose from any range of colors for custom shadows and highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone typically works best when an image has a high contrast, which means a wide-ranging spread between the light and dark colors. Darker shadows and lighter highlights make for more visually stunning filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used with the Cover block, users can add filters to both image and video backgrounds. However, they also have access to the typical overlay color or gradient option. This provides a ton of flexibility for customizing media.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Duotone filter + gradient overlay on a Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>Because the duotone feature works with an inline SVG file under the hood, it also means that using it does not permanently change image or video files. Users can still use their original media elsewhere on the site without uploading a second copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other possibilities outside of just laying a couple of colors on top of an image. Bence Szab&oacute; wrote an extensive tutorial on using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-patterns-with-svg-filters/\">SVG filters for patterns</a> on CSS-Tricks. This could be a route for background options in the future &mdash; <em><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-patterns-with-svg-filters/#pine-wood\">wood grain, anyone?</a></em> Maybe not every possibility is suitable for core WordPress, but I would love to see plugin authors taking a stab at some alternatives.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 02:04:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.8 Release Candidate 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10933\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3239:\"<p>The third release candidate for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-8/\">WordPress 5.8</a> is now available! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is slated for release on <strong>July 20, 2021</strong>, and we need <em>your</em> help to get there—if you have not tried 5.8 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.8 release candidate 3 in any of these three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (select the <code>Bleeding edge</code> channel and then <code>Beta/RC Only</code> stream)</li><li>Directly download the release candidate version <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.8-RC3.zip\">(zip)</a></li><li>Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=5.8-RC3</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to all of the contributors who tested the&nbsp;Beta/RC releases and gave feedback.

The company advocates for open source software, open source hardware, and open data, while providing a central point of collaboration for people working in the open sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of the Open report offers a broad overview of the UK&rsquo;s open source ecosystem. This collection of research includes surveys of UK companies, interviews, industry reports, and analysis from different publications. It was sponsored by GitHub, SUSE, and the Open Invention Network, and conducted by <a href=\"http://smoothmedia.com/\">Smoothmedia</a> consulting firm under the direction of ethnographer and social researcher Dr. Jennifer Barth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key findings in <a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/openuk_stateofope2021_report_FINALCHANGES_08.pdf\">Phase 1</a> of the report include research demonstrating that open source software contributes an estimated &pound;43.1 billion to the UK economy, with the UK ringing in as Europe&rsquo;s largest contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/State-of-Open-Phase-Two.pdf\">Phase 2</a> covers open source adoption in the UK. Researchers found a staggering 97% of the 273 UK businesses surveyed use some form of open source software:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We found that 97% of businesses of different sizes in all sectors of the UK economy use open source software technology. Although resources became a more pressing concern during the pandemic, 64% of businesses in our sample experienced business growth which translated into a high recruitment drive for roles relating to open source software in the past 12 months (see recruitment findings). Further, we find that almost half of businesses surveyed (48%) are using open source software more as digital adoption becomes embedded in organisational culture and business.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Other key findings from Phase 2 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>53% of non-tech organizations contribute to open source software projects</li><li>77% of UK public sector looks to open source for skills developmen </li><li>Over half (54%) have written policies and processes for open source contributions</li><li>89% run open source software internally in their business</li><li>Approximately two thirds (65%) contribute to open source software projects</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting observation from the contribution data is that smaller companies are more likely to contribute back to open source than larger companies. Smaller companies are also more likely to use open source software in their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StateOfOpen?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StateOfOpen</a> report from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openuk_uk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@openuk_uk</a>, it\'s clear that businesses of all sizes make key use of open source. The report correlates company size and open source involvement, showing smaller companies more active in contributing to open source. <a href=\"https://t.co/A7dz3pjqFm\">https://t.co/A7dz3pjqFm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L5qeRrs9Xc\">pic.twitter.com/L5qeRrs9Xc</a></p>&mdash; Aiven (@aiven_io) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aiven_io/status/1414556406703869956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Survey respondents cited &ldquo;saving on costs&rdquo; as the main reason for adopting open source (75%), followed by more collaboration (72%), skill development (64%), the quality of code (61%), and security (52%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase 3 is planned to be published in September 2021. This report will focus on UK data with a methodology tailored to reveal the value of open source software to the digital economy. It will also include case studies that demonstrate the non-economic, intangible benefits of open source software, such as skills development and collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The published <a href=\"https://openuk.uk/stateofopen/\">reports</a> are lengthy but will be of particular interest to companies working in the UK and Europe, especially consultancies that may need to justify using open source technologies in engineering decisions. OpenUK plans to conduct a further survey in 2022 as part of this effort to estimate the impact of open source on the UK economy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 04:20:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Contributing to Open Source Is ‘Better Than Any College Degree’\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=118776\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:187:\"https://wptavern.com/contributing-to-open-source-is-better-than-any-college-degree?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=contributing-to-open-source-is-better-than-any-college-degree\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7666:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A week ago, I published my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/taking-the-leap-building-my-first-wordpress-block-plugin\">thoughts on the block system</a> from a developer&rsquo;s perspective. Taking a weekend-afternoon deep dive into creating custom block types meant learning some tough lessons and familiarizing myself with a programming language I had little experience using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming has always been a trial-and-error affair for me: write code, refresh the browser, read the error message, and attempt to fix the problem. Then, simply rinse and repeat the process until the program is not broken. Those mistakes are woven into the art of coding, the layers underneath that poetry on the visible canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have absolutely made the same mistake twice. And, thrice. Probably a lot more than that if I am being honest with myself and you. Eventually, I stop making those same mistakes, and some method or procedure is permanently seared into my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have written a few hundred WordPress tutorials in the past decade and a half. I am a twice-published author of development books and served as a tech editor on another. However, I am not much of a reader of tech books and documentation. For one, programmers are not necessarily the most engaging writers. Plus, <em>book smarts</em> can only get you so far. You need the <em>street smarts</em> of programming to become good at it, which means learning from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I firmly believe that reading is a central part of that, there is no replacement for getting your hands dirty. Building things, making mistakes, and learning to fix them is what makes programming fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on open-source software like WordPress is one of the best ways to do that. There is no upfront cost, assuming you have access to a computer, a prerequisite to programming of any kind. There are usually people willing to lend a hand or answer questions, and there are always problems to solve for those ready to dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress Executive Director <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy chatted with Matt Mullenweg</a> on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/openverse-why-this-project-is-good-for-wordpress-and-the-web\">Openverse project</a> a couple of months ago, there was a moment that I found myself nodding my head in agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Because, of course, you know, contributing and being involved with open source is probably the best way to learn a technology, better than any college degree.</p><cite><em>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress Project Lead</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned more about WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by contributing to open-source software than I ever learned in a college course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in a generation that was told that we must get a college degree. It was an integral part of the American dream that would result in suburban life in a neighborhood with perfectly aligned rows of houses, ending in a cul-de-sac. It was the first step toward a two-car garage, white-picket-fence, 2.5 kids, and a dog. College was the promise that my peers and I hinged everything on. It was expected of us, and so many of us did our duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the thing that our parents did not know. The internet would change everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated high school in 2002. This was during that stretch where the online world was exploding. All of the world&rsquo;s knowledge would soon be at our fingertips. Today that is truer than ever. Anything you will ever need to learn about writing code is available through an internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience with college-level courses in programming was mixed, but I learned a necessary life lesson from them: I was not cut out for a degree in software engineering. I am glad I wised up early on and pursued a different degree, saving myself some time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rocked my half-summer C programming class, my introduction to writing code. I also had a passionate professor who once worked on U.S. missile projects as a bug-tester. It was probably not the most glamorous job, but he always made it sound exciting because he loved what he was doing. Our class was tasked with building various programs throughout the course, but we usually had a choice in what we were building. For my group&rsquo;s final project, we created vending machine software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on the fast track to becoming a software engineer after that first class. I had built a way for merchants to get paid for delivering sugary treats and soft drinks to customers. It was capitalism meeting programming, and I had a taste for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall semester rolled around, and I was motivated to move beyond the realm of procedural programming in C. Java, an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, would be my next challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most advanced thing our class built for an entire semester was a basic calculator. I skipped nearly every lecture because I could not stay awake watching the professor chicken-peck his way through programs for three hours every week. I attended the mandatory &ldquo;labs&rdquo; &mdash; basically a fancy way of saying an extra class where the professor&rsquo;s assistants would teach the actual coursework. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, my fire died down. While calculator programs are handy tools, I wanted to branch out and build things that mattered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You know what reignited my flame for programming?</em> At first, it was general web development. But, WordPress was what I really became passionate about. And, I have not looked back since I started using it in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was my gateway into a world where I could create things that interested me. I could jump ahead into a project far more advanced than my skill level, trial-and-error my way ahead, and eventually build something that others found value in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless universities have changed, most teach step-by-step foundational lessons to their pupils. Some students may luck out and land in that unique professor&rsquo;s class who gives them leeway to explore various ideas. However, there is no substitute for creating something of your own, solving a problem that you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is what programming is all about &mdash; solving problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, I released my first WordPress plugin into the wild. It automatically listed all of the subpages of the currently-viewed page. Dozens of similar plugins have been written since and probably before (<em>it seems WordPress would have a simple &ldquo;list subpages&rdquo; function by now</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, after writing a new plugin, I was reminded of the free education that the WordPress community has given me over the years. Some of it has been reading documentation. Some from WordPress Stack Exchange answers. Other bits have been studying from those who came before me, building upon their open-source code. All of it was from other people giving something back to our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not necessarily a knock on college.  Some people perform better in that structured environment, and there is value in all forms of education. However, there are alternatives for those who cannot afford college or learn better in a different environment.  And, there is no discounting the experience you get from contributing to something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of our readers thinking about getting into programming, just dive in. Make some mistakes.

You can change the layout for post title, featured image, excerpt and link.  An early version of this was the Latest Post Block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team also implemented a series of Block Patterns of a few nice variations to display a post list on templates, post and pages. It&#8217;s a fun feature, and it has taken quite a long time to build. The wait was definitely worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mighty and could be the most powerful feature in 5.8 as <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> headlined his post <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Query Loop: The Ins and Outs</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allison Rivers</strong> over the Torque Magazine also published an article <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2021/07/what-is-wordpress-5-8s-query-loop-block/\"><strong>What is the Query Loop Block?</strong></a> with lots of great insights and examples. Rivers also has a list of plugins that implemented some advanced features the WordPress version is still missing with its first iteration. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Building and Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading throught the release notes for Gutenberg 11, I found great gem posted by <strong>Riad Benguella</strong>.

The release is geared up to be the most feature-packed update the community has seen in a while. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">Block-based widgets</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">the pattern directory</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">WebP image support</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">template-editing mode</a>, and many more tools are nearly ready to ship to the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one of the most powerful features is the Query Loop block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the terms &ldquo;Query&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loop,&rdquo; they are vital concepts within WordPress. Traditionally, they were only necessary for theme and plugin development. However, through the Query Loop block, users will gain exposure to what is, for all intents and purposes, the backbone of how WordPress displays posts on a site&rsquo;s front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Queries? Loops?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Not everyone will be immediately familiar with these developer terms that WordPress is plopping down in the user interface. For theme and plugin authors, these are everyday concepts. However, even some users who have been using the platform for a decade have never been exposed to them. So, we should get some basic definitions in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;Query&rdquo; is simpler than you might think. It merely means to &ldquo;query&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask&rdquo; for posts from the database according to a defined set of options. For example, one might attempt to get the last 10 blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Loop&rdquo; is an even easier concept to grasp. It means to &ldquo;loop&rdquo; or &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; through each queried post and output it. Technically, a developer could do things other than displaying the posts during this process, but we are only concerned with what gets printed on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two things combined become the Query Loop block. It allows users to ask for a set of posts and display each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a Post Template block, which throws a wrinkle in all of this. Aside from the word &ldquo;template&rdquo; being overused in WordPress for various features, this is a new method for an old concept. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors would write out all the HTML and call specific template tags within the queried posts loop to show things like the post title, author, content, and more. This is easy to do within a PHP file. However, in the block editor, there needed to be a new way to group these things together. The Post Template block acts as this group, housing the things users want to display in the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress also has a variation on the Query Loop block called Posts List. They do the same thing, but the latter has a more user-friendly title than the former. The only problem with this variation is that, when it is inserted, the user still sees the same &ldquo;Query Loop&rdquo; block title. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32268\">ticket to fix this</a>, but it is unlikely to make it into WordPress 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query Loop Pattern Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When first inserting a Query Loop into the editor, WordPress will introduce users to another version 5.8 feature: the pattern inserter. Instead of having immediate access to interact with the block, users can select from a list of predefined patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the inserter is a carousel that lets users can scroll through patterns individually:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: carousel view.\n\n\n\n<p>However, they can switch to a grid-based layout and view all of the patterns at once:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: grid view.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is set to ship with six Query Loop patterns by default, unless more are added in the coming days:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Standard</li><li>Image at left</li><li>Small image and title</li><li>Grid</li><li>Large title</li><li>Offset</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not particularly fond of any of the default patterns other than the &ldquo;Large title&rdquo; one (shown in the screenshots above with the black background and white text). For this block to shine, users will need to build out their own designs or wait for theme authors to begin bundling custom Query Loop patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is how it should be. Core WordPress should ship some basics while letting our community of theme designers showcase their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A custom simple blog posts listing.\n\n\n\n<p>This is also an opportunity for theme authors to offer alternatives to their custom page template designs. It is not time to throw them out entirely. However, it is a way to begin recreating old ideas in the block era, such as building out eCommerce plugin integrations, portfolio grids, and much more. Some of the tools are still limited (we are getting to those next), but there is enough initial groundwork for exploration, helping users experience WordPress in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Query Loop block has several options for users to customize which posts to <em>query</em> the database for:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop block and its options.\n\n\n\n<p>In the block toolbar, there is a &ldquo;Display settings&rdquo; button. When clicked, it creates a popover with options for how many posts to show:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Items per Page:</strong> Number of posts to display per page</li><li><strong>Offset:</strong> Number of posts to skip over</li><li><strong>Max page to show:</strong> Limit pages (this requires using one of the Query Pagination blocks)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; panel in the Query Loop&rsquo;s block sidebar has several secondary options. Users can enable &ldquo;Inherit query from template&rdquo; to use WordPress&rsquo;s global query, but this is mostly useless for WordPress 5.8 users without the Gutenberg plugin enabled and a block-based theme. For now, you will almost always want to disable this option. This will grant access to a slew of new choices, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Post type</li><li>Ordering</li><li>Filters panel for categories, tags, author, and keyword</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Settings and Filters panels are the most fine-tuned pieces of the Query Loop block. The development team struck a sensible balance between ease-of-use and the dozens of query-related parameters available through code. It provides users with a ton of power right of the gate but should be flexible enough in the future for plugin authors to extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Post Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When inserting a Query Loop, the editor automatically adds its inner Post Template block. This is where most of the magic happens. Users can directly change how their posts appear. Primarily, they will do so by adding blocks from the Theme category, many of which are for outputting post-related data.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme-categorized blocks for outputting dynamic data.\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all other blocks are available for insertion here too. However, many of them will not be great candidates for use within the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that may not be immediately evident is that changes you make to one post within the Post Template block will affect all others. So, if you add a Video or Buttons block here, they will be identical. Remember, this is a &ldquo;template&rdquo; for designing how all posts within the Query Loop will appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback for customizing the Post Template block output is the lack of design options for some of the blocks. It is easy to build something like a simple post list:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Posts list with titles and dates.\n\n\n\n<p>You can also build a layout like a portfolio project grid, as shown in the following screenshot. However, the Post Featured Image block does not currently have sizing controls, so you are stuck with your theme&rsquo;s default post-thumbnail size &mdash; assuming it is actually registered. <em>Experiences may vary. Wildly.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />Building a basic portfolio grid.\n\n\n\n<p>For more advanced things than changing typography, colors, and spacing, users will need to wait for WordPress 5.9 and beyond. However, theme authors still have the block styles API at their disposal.

The Meta team acted swiftly to resolve the issue and return the snippet to its former meta description. It is not known how long Google has been pulling from the text in the recommended hosts sections to populate the snippet, but the code is now more explicit about the fact that those companies are not the most important content on the Download page.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 02:05:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: Awesome Motive Acquires SearchWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://wptavern.com/awesome-motive-acquires-searchwp?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=awesome-motive-acquires-searchwp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4345:\"<p>Awesome Motive, the company behind <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/\">MonsterInsights</a>, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\">OptinMonster</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\">WPForms</a>, and several other popular products, has acquired <a href=\"https://searchwp.com/\">SearchWP</a>, a commercial plugin that enhances WordPress&rsquo; search functionality. No changes have been announced for the plugin and Awesome Motive CEO Syed Balkhi says it will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for current customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have built a lot of internal tools to improve our website search that I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sharing with the WordPress community,&rdquo; Balkhi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We will be combining Jon&rsquo;s vision with our own experience, so you can literally have the best search plugin in the industry without the high costs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, when Jon Christopher launched SearchWP, he quickly carved out a slice of the WordPress search market among early competitors. The freemium model was already popular in those days with plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/\">Relevanssi</a>, but Christopher chose to launch SearchWP as a commercial-only product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There was already freemium competition, and I felt that the pricing model (which is the same today) was stronger given the product itself,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I saw the pricing model as something that would help SearchWP stand out, and I also wanted to avoid opening the doors to overwhelming amounts of support requests right from the start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had no idea if SearchWP would be successful given the landscape, I built it first to scratch my own itch while knowing that even if no one bought it, I would 100% use it in my own work, and use it&nbsp;<em>a lot</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His gamble paid off and the plugin has been used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Christopher had one support contractor but otherwise had been running the business alone for the past eight years. WordPress&rsquo; growing market share has made one-person plugin businesses difficult to maintain once they become very popular, as seen in the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">sale of ACF to Delicious Brains</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was looking ahead and considering what would be best for SearchWP&rsquo;s customers,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I want SearchWP to live as long as it possibly can. If I&rsquo;m by myself it&rsquo;s a bit of a risk to continue that way as the business continues to grow. I know that I prefer to build things from the ground up, and I also know that I&rsquo;m not the guy to build (or manage) a team, it&rsquo;s not my strong suit. Given all of those pieces it was clear to me that it was a good time to consider selling.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher described the 2013 WordPress ecosystem as more &ldquo;scrappy,&rdquo; as developers launched product businesses and worked to figure it out along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are pros and cons to an environment like that, but it was fantastic from my perspective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Over time that feeling went away as companies grew, matured, and playbooks began to take shape. That cycle has continued over time and especially in the last 18 months we&rsquo;re getting a look at where WordPress is headed &ndash; lots of big players in a really big space.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are jumping into the waters with a new product business, Christopher underscored the need for strong marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that a lack of serious marketing will in fact be a limiter in today&rsquo;s WordPress economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Products that have been around a long time have a natural momentum that&rsquo;s really tough to beat, but that momentum doesn&rsquo;t come without friction. In order to keep up with where WordPress is going, I do feel like you need assets (and capital) aimed directly and solely at marketing for the long haul.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balkhi did not elaborate on Awesome Motive&rsquo;s immediate plans for the search plugin but said the company will be executing on a 12-month plan to make it easier for beginners and non-technical business owners to set up in less than 10 minutes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 03:17:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.0 Includes Over 70 Bug Fixes, Continues Improving With WordPress 5.8 Just Two Weeks Away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119703\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:265:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6795:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.0 landed yesterday with a pile of changes. The development team has been moving fast, and it shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a two-week cycle, version 11.0 includes an insane number of bug fixes. Contributors squashed over 70 in this release alone. This seems to be in preparation for WordPress 5.8, which is expected to land on July 20. The upcoming block-based Widgets screen had the lion&rsquo;s share of bugs. However, the block library had nearly two dozen, many of those issues with new theme-related blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside of such a massive release is that there are too many features and not enough time to cover them all. I will be cherry-picking some of my favorites, but feel free to dive into the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.0.0\">release notes</a> for a complete picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme and Template-Editing Mode Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the primary Full Site Editing features making its way to WordPress 5.8 will be disabled by default for most users. In a rare move from the core project, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32858\">template editor will be opt-in</a>, at least for users with classic themes.  It is opt-out for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">wrote last month</a>, until users are on actual block themes, the template editor is &ldquo;a sort-of-OK-but-kind-of-amazing landing page creator.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template-editing is really only as good as the weakest link in the system. This will almost always be the theme over the next few months. Because the template editor is a new feature that directly attempts to overwrite the front-end output, it will always be at odds with many themes that were never designed with it in mind. The opt-in approach is unlikely the best route to mass adoption, but it is in the interest of the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making it opt-in also allows theme authors to make template editing a smooth experience. Gutenberg 11.0 introduces a new <code>defaultBlockTemplate</code> editor setting. Theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32771\">create the default blocks</a> that users begin with when creating a new template.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Starting with a custom default block template.\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, this default template should include some base layout components, such as a header, footer, and post/page content. However, themers are free to put their own spin on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on creating default block templates, theme authors should read Themes Team rep Carolina Nymark&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/07/08/summary-theme-features-in-wordpress-5-8/\">overview of WordPress 5.8 theme features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Media &amp; Text Block: Drag-and-Drop Media Replacement</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Dragging a new media file into the Media &amp; Text block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users have long been able to drag and drop an initial image or video into the Media &amp; Text block. However, they were unable to replace it using the same method. Gutenberg 11.0 creates a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29710\">&ldquo;drop zone&rdquo; over the media column</a>, making it easy to change the media to something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature already exists with the Cover and Image blocks, so this change brings Media &amp; Text up to date. We probably should have had this feature months ago, but the patch sat in limbo waiting for a code review.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessibility: Categories Dropdown Has Label</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Label difference between the Archives and Categories blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The development team added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33060\">&ldquo;Categories&rdquo; label</a> when the Categories block is shown as a dropdown. This is a welcome improvement to help those using screen-readers better navigate the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this change is the lack of consistency. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-8-adds-new-typography-controls-and-block-previews\">Gutenberg 10.8</a>, the team removed the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class for the Archives block label, making it appear on screen for all users. These types of inconsistencies that seem trivial on the surface tend to pile up, creating code bloat for theme designers in the long run as they try to wrangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would prefer both labels to be marked as screen-reader text. Regardless of the default, the two should match. Then, throw in an option for the end-user to decide whether to show the label similar to how the Search form handles it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Return of Post Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Post classes appear for Post Template block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those theme designers who need them, Gutenberg 11.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30497\">brings back post classes</a>. If you are wondering where posts classes had gone, you may not be alone. In the world of blocks, they are not needed as much as they once were. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors used these classes to dynamically change the output of a post based on contexts such as type, format, category, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Post Template block (formerly named Query Loop) was introduced, there was a noticeable lack of the traditional classes attached to the wrapper for individual posts. This latest update brings them back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, block themes will likely rely on these classes less and less. With much of the design configuration moving to <code>theme.json</code> files and user-controlled options, it is probably time to say goodbye to one of the core features of theme design over the past decade. However, it is a comfort to know it is there when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decimals Allowed in Spacing Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those who are particular about getting their margin and padding <em>just</em> right, they can finally rejoice. Spacing controls now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32692\">allow for decimal values</a> and not just whole numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past versions of the plugin, a value such as <code>1.5</code> would be rounded up to <code>2</code>. When used with <code>rem</code> and <code>em</code> units, such rounding created a 50% difference between the intended spacing and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy about this one. It is a fix for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31964\">one of the tickets</a> I opened (<em>hooray for contributing!</em>). However, I cannot take credit for fixing the problem.

However, each folder gets its own sub-menu link under the Notes section in the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Hypernotes&rsquo; folder system.\n\n\n\n<p>This more closely mimics other note-taking apps where users can switch between various folders to quickly find notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code to make this happen is simple; the idea is ingenious. It is the sort of outside-the-box thinking I love to see from plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few trivial issues with it, such as the folder names not being highlighted when viewing their screens. However, that is a WordPress-specific bug. A simple dash before each folder name could spruce up the UI a bit too. They sit below the &ldquo;All Notes&rdquo; menu item, so it would create more of a folder effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the plugin works well as a note-taking application.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Writing a note in the WordPress editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin description does have a security note for users who are wondering just how private their content is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Only you will be able to see your notes within the WordPress admin, but the notes are NOT encrypted at the moment, so anyone with database access will be able to read them.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes also ensures that no post is ever accidentally published for all the world to see. Under the hood, it automatically sets all notes to the &ldquo;private&rdquo; status. The plugin&rsquo;s post type cannot be publicly queried on the front end either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the plugin does not create custom capabilities (permissions) for its post type and taxonomy. Any registered user on the site with the right post-editing capabilities can access others&rsquo; notes in the backend, such as people with the Editor role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is unlikely an issue given the nature of the plugin. I imagine the primary audience will be made up of solo bloggers who want a simple note-taking solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into one not-so-trivial issue when I began trying out Hypernotes, believing my website was broken. This is usually because of a patch I am testing for the Gutenberg plugin or just one of its run-of-the-mill updates. However, the typical culprit was not to blame. After a half-hour or so trying to figure out why my theme styles were not appearing for Note posts, I finally cracked the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes disables all theme editor styles. The beautiful typography of my currently active theme was gone, which would work well with a note or journaling plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was easy enough to overrule with a few lines of custom code. If I was going to save a few quotes that I liked as personal notes, I at least wanted to do it in style:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Bringing back my theme&rsquo;s custom quotes style.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also attempts to disable wide/full alignment and theme editor font sizes. The code it uses works for traditional WordPress themes but not for block themes, which have a different mechanism for registering such support. This was also one of the reasons it was tough to track down the issue. Everything else from my theme was working but custom editor styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the idea behind removing support for those features. Themes design the front end of the site, and Hypernotes is purely a backend tool. However, I would rather see an option for letting the user control what gets disabled. Some theme editor styles would pair well with the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disabling these features has other implications too. For example, all of my theme&rsquo;s custom block style variations were registered and usable from the editor. However, because my styles were not loaded, they did not work correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option would be for the plugin to provide its own editor styles. There would still be some complications going that route, such as the block style variations issue, but the plugin could become a beautifully designed note-taking app in its own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a version 1.0 outing, I am a fan of the simplicity. More so, I am impressed with the clever method of handling note &ldquo;folders.&rdquo; I am eager to see how this plugin evolves over future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 03:13:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Open Insulin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=54516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2021/07/open-insulin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:895:\"<p>One of my big themes is that open source will transform every industry, with key examples being WordPress in web publishing, WooCommerce in online commerce, Wikipedia in reference, and Bitcoin/Ethereum in finance.

It also makes it possible to add a bearded man or a bearded woman in all skin tone variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will also include significant changes to the syringe emoji that were committed to a previous version of Twemoji (13.0.2) earlier this year. Instead of a blood-filled barrel accented with drops of blood leaking out of the tip, the new syringe emoji contains a non-specific liquid. This makes it more flexible for use cases that don&rsquo;t involve removing blood. Emojipedia has a fascinating look at <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/vaccine-emoji-comes-to-life/\">the syringe emoji&rsquo;s history</a>, dating back to 1999 when it was primarily used in Japan for blood donation. A 2021 refresh on the syringe makes it possible for it to be used in reference to vaccines, a topic of public conversation across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to changes to the syringe, Jonathan Desrosiers, who opened the trac ticket to initiate the update, summarized a few other changes from previous Twemoji versions that modify existing emoji:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cricket: the colors have been adjusted to improve readability on small screens and to prevent confusion with other Emoji that had a similar color.</li><li>T-Rex: The color and posture of the T-Rex has been adjusted.</li><li>Portuguese flag: A line within the flag&rsquo;s circle has been corrected.</li><li>Thai flag: The proportions of the stripes for this flag have been corrected.</li><li>Fox face: The symmetry has been improved.</li><li>Transgender flag: The lines have been updated to prevent small gaps between stripes from showing when rendered with antialiasing.</li><li>Rolling on the floor laughing: Adjusted to be less exaggerated and appear more natural.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The official emoji lexicon is constantly being tweaked and updated for accuracy, and to better serve conversations, as current events increase demand for visual representations of specific objects and emotions. Although many of these updates and new additions may seem pandemic-inspired, there&rsquo;s a lengthy, official process for proposing changes to the Unicode Consortium. The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee reviews <a href=\"https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html\">proposals</a>, which require compelling data on compatibility, expected usage level, distinctiveness, and other factors. Candidates approved for inclusion do not arrive to major platforms for approximately a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will bump Twemoji from 13.0.1 to 13.1.0. Unicode 14.0, the next major update, is expected for release in late 2021. Emojipedia has a <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/emoji-14.0/\">draft list</a> of what is on deck for the next version and those that are approved would likely make it to major platforms by the end of 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Jul 2021 05:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 9.9 Released With a Refreshed Image Gallery Carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3094:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Today, Automattic <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/07/06/jetpack-9-9-make-your-best-photos-shine/\">released version 9.9</a> of its popular Jetpack plugin. The development team improved the modal animation and transition speed for the Instant Search module and added the Social Preview panel to the pre-publish sidebar. However, the most notable user-facing update was a refresh of its Carousel feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The module creates a fullscreen overlay gallery of a post&rsquo;s images once one is clicked. Users can <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/carousel/\">enable this feature</a> via the Jetpack &gt; Settings &gt; Writing page in the WordPress admin. Users can also turn on the display of EXIF data and the media attachment commenting form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Carousel handles Image and Gallery blocks a bit differently. Regardless of whether Gallery images are linked or not, they will always be included in the image carousel when clicked. However, only Image blocks that specifically link to the attachment page are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have never much cared for the Jetpack Carousel feature. There were always prettier image-overlay, lightbox-type solutions out in the wild. We use the plugin here at WP Tavern, so it is just something I have learned to live with. There was no sense in installing <em>yet another</em> plugin when we were already using the massive mono-project to run many other features on the site. And, it generally got the job done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today, I can finally say that I am happy with the implementation. It is cleaner, offers a larger viewing area for individual images, and tucks unnecessary bits away for the average user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a screenshot of the carousel in all its fullscreen wonder:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.9.\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, here is what the same image slide looks like in Jetpack 9.8.1:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.8.1.\n\n\n\n<p>In the new version, the image metadata and commenting form are hidden by default. The user must click the info or comment icon buttons to slide each section open. This is a better implementation because it decreases the noise in the carousel while still making the features available for those who want them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image metadata in the carousel.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I am enjoying this update. Swiping and scrolling through the gallery feels smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love for WordPress to bring a standard set of functions and blocks for displaying media metadata to the development community. Every plugin and theme author who wants to showcase that info must build a custom system for their projects, such as formatting aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. The following is the output of an image attachment page from a theme I have worked on:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom theme image info.\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reason that the theme and Jetpack should be working with custom wrappers for the metadata. WordPress stores EXIF and ID3 tags automatically.

I closed all the windows, shuttered the blinds, switched on a couple of fans for white noise, and clicked the television on. My cats and I relaxed. It is my job to keep them calm while my &mdash; usually drunken &mdash; compatriots burn hundreds of dollars away in the night sky. It is my ritual, and I enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this holiday, we re-watched Season 1 of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, and I learned how to build a block plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not my first attempt. When the block editor launched nearly three years ago, I tinkered with a few block type ideas. However, I never got far. Documentation was sparse, and I had almost no experience with JavaScript beyond building trivial bells and whistles for front-end design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving my day job as a developer to write for WP Tavern also meant limited time to learn block development. And, my free time for the last couple of years has been filled with other projects. Lately, I have had the urge to jump back in and start building things for fun once again. My extended sabbatical from development work gave me time to pursue other interests while allowing my well of creativeness a chance to refill. The break did me some good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time to kill yesterday afternoon, I dove right in. After a couple of hours of reading docs, studying other developers&rsquo; code, and breaking things, I had a functional block for a breadcrumbs list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom block registered and ready to insert.\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus Kazmierczak&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/copyright-block/\">Copyright Block</a> plugin helped me get over one of the initial humps. It was helpful to see real-world, non-example code written in vanilla JavaScript to get to the meat of how the system worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My overall thoughts on building custom block types?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easier than I thought it would be. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Documentation</a> is, at the same time, both overwhelming and limiting. It is tough to find the correct answer if you do not even know what you are looking for. The barrier to entry is much higher than when I built my first plugin in 2007. The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/writing-your-first-block-type/\">Block Type API</a> makes some things stupidly simple but complicates others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successfully inserting my first block type into the editor canvas was gratifying. I don&rsquo;t think that feeling ever goes away as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Successful insertion and rendering of my first block plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited about the potential for blocks, such as a breadcrumbs list, when the site editor launches. Many similar features do not make sense in the post editor. However, when users can make direct edits to their templates, it will open a world of possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning Curve</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I know enough JavaScript to be a danger to myself and others. Having spent almost the entirety of my professional career in the WordPress realm has meant focusing on PHP. But, programming is programming. Once you have a strong understanding of one language, it not an impossible leap to piddle around enough to create a functional script in another. Most of the same foundational concepts are there. The hurdle is often with learning some new syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the biggest obstacle with &ldquo;modern&rdquo; JavaScript is setting up the build tools, bundlers, and more. It can be a tall order to even type out that first line of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some of the documentation has vanilla JavaScript examples, but when you get into anything more complex than the basics, it is not so vanilla anymore. You will need a way to bundle JavaScript and transform JSX syntax. That means tools like webpack and Babel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/js-build-setup/\">WordPress has its own script</a> for cutting through most of the complexity, but I recommend <a href=\"https://laravel-mix.com/\">Laravel Mix</a>. It is simple enough for even the least-savvy JavaScript programmers among us and has thorough documentation. It is a script made for folks who want to worry less about tooling and more about actually writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block building is also a different kind of leap. Whether it was custom template tags, shortcodes, widgets, or hooks, traditional WordPress development has meant building those in a PHP environment.  I suspect that most plugin developers have tons of features that they can bring to the masses via the block editor. They will often rely on server-side rendering. WordPress has a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-server-side-render/\"><code>ServerSideRender</code> componen</a>t for actually handling this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the handiest features of registering block types is the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/\">block &ldquo;supports&rdquo; system</a>. <em>Want a background color option?</em> Just one line of code will do. <em>Want the user to access the font-size control?</em> That is a single line too. With little effort, I extended my breadcrumbs block to include a ton of styling options for users. And, they adapt to the site&rsquo;s active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing various combination of block-supported styling options.\n\n\n\n<p>The list of block-supported features offers an array of standardized options at pretty much no development cost. Even the Customize API, previously the most advanced tool for building form fields, did not come this close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/block-controls-toolbar-and-sidebar/\">Building custom inspector controls</a> was straightforward once I got the hang of how the block edit piece of the puzzle worked. For now, I have a simple toggle option for enabling/disabling a feature. Often, the hardest part is just finding what you are looking for. WordPress has a massive library of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/\">components</a> to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I have a basic block on the client (editor) side. Most of the complexity is handled on the server via PHP. If I could build this in an afternoon while attending to nervous cats, it should not be a stretch for more plugin authors to hop aboard this train. There are thousands of shortcodes and widgets that developers can convert to blocks with minimal code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not ready to release my breadcrumbs block into the wild just yet. There is still some fine-tuning left to do and a few advanced features to implement. Also, a breadcrumbs list is primarily needed in a site editor context where users can drop it into something like their header template. We are not there yet, but I will undoubtedly share the final result with the community when we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I will try to build a block that does not rely on server-side rendering. I think I have the hang of it now. Breaking through that initial barrier is always the hardest step.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:28:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 12: WordPress – In Person!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/episode-12-wordpress-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13116:\"<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy talks about WordPress &#8211; In Person!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Gutenberg Times: Block-Based Widget Screen and DevNotes Galore for WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #176\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-based-widget-screen-weekend-edition-176/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19897:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>July is the month celebrating North American Independence (for white people) and the start of the French Revolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy 154th Birthday, Canada 🇨🇦  (July 1st). <br />Happy 245th Birthday, USA 🇺🇸 (July 4th) <br />Happy 232nd Bastille Day, France 🇫🇷  (July 14th) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many more countries celebrating Independence Day in July, though. <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/culture-entertainment/holidays/national-holidays-around-world\">Here is the list.

While the WPAdmin Widget screen feels like a good block editor, he wrote about the block widgets in the Customizer: &#8220;Customizer support for block widgets is light years ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging.

The company raised money from all the investors in this round via a SAFE note, which founder and CEO Craig Hewitt said is a fairly standard investment vehicle for companies at Castos&rsquo; stage of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;On both the individual and corporate investor side I think the investors see the vision that we have for what the Private Podcasting market can mean for Castos and want to help us achieve that potential,&rdquo; Hewitt said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private Podcasting is a growing trend where creators and organizations broadcast to supporters in a more intimate format that isn&rsquo;t open to the public. Hewitt likens them to membership sites, except in audio format. It is often used by people who are running membership sites, courses, or online communities as a way to stay connected with members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The other application is companies wanting a way to connect with their employees in audio format,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;Podcasting is perfect for that because it&rsquo;s mobile-first, on-demand, and can be consumed asynchronously.&nbsp; We call it the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://castos.com/step-away-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">Step Away Experience</a>.&nbsp;Companies that are adopting Private Podcasting internally are giving their team members a way to consume their internal content without being tied to their computer on a Zoom call or glued to Slack.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castos is developing a mobile app specifically targeted at the private podcasting market. Hewitt&rsquo;s team is aiming to have the app become a place where people can listen to all of the private podcasts for which they have a subscription. Listeners would simply use the app instead of going through the process of manually subscribing to all their private podcasts via RSS feed. New episodes will appear automatically in the app for subscribers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For our corporate clients, the ability to white label our app with their own branding/style is a big win,&rdquo; Hewitt said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a much more secure way to distribute private podcast content.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no RSS feed to share around, no files to download (our app is streaming only to offer more security to those files).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcasting-during-the-pandemic-castos-sees-300-growth-in-new-podcasters\">ramped up unprecedented interest in podcasting</a> when lockdowns were in place across the globe. Even with vaccines more readily available now, Hewitt said Castos is still witnessing strong growth in the podcasting industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are all the new podcasters in the market now since so many launched podcasts during the pandemic, but now that people are traveling again and commuting to work we&rsquo;re seeing listenership going up quite a bit,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a trend we expect to continue into the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past 10 months, Castos has grown to serve nearly 3,500 customers and the team has grown from seven employees to 13. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/\">Seriously Simple Podcasting</a> plugin is used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Castos is actively <a href=\"http://castos.com/careers\">hiring for several roles</a> right now, thanks to the new round of fundraising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All of the funds will go towards growing our team,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;This will be pretty evenly split between product (designers and developers) and Sales and Marketing roles &ndash; more people, more energy, more great minds working on ways that we can better serve our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Jul 2021 02:18:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Biratnagar Announces Plans for Ujwal Thapa Memorial Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3468:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier this week, the WordPress Biratnagar Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wordpressbrt/posts/1170172963498116\">announced a WordCamp scholarship</a> in honor of Ujwal Thapa. The goal is to honor the legacy left behind by one of Nepal&rsquo;s leaders both inside and outside of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thapa <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ujwal-thapa-co-founder-of-the-wordpress-nepal-community-passes-away\">passed away a month ago</a> at age 44 from complications with COVID-19. He was a political activist, founding the Bibeksheel Nepali party, originally a peaceful movement against corruption and social injustice. He was the co-founder of WordPress Nepal, a group that has grown to 8,000 members. He was also a close friend and mentor to many in the community and helped many more launch careers in the IT industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After the untimely death of WordPress contributor and co-founder of WordPress Nepal Ujwal Thapa in 2021, due to COVID-19, the WordPress Biratnagar community decided on this scholarship,&rdquo; wrote the WordPress Biratnagar team. &ldquo;Ujwal was a dedicated patron to the WordPress community in Nepal, and the WordPress Biratnagar decided to pay applause to his memory in this way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scholarship will cover the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Travel to Biratnagar from within Nepal.</li><li>Hotel stay for the duration of the event.</li><li>A ticket to <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Biratnagar</a>.</li><li>Local transportation.</li><li>Meals outside the official event.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is still struggling with getting COVID-19 cases under control at the moment. The CDC <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-4/coronavirus-nepal\">lists the country</a> as &ldquo;very high&rdquo; risk and recommends avoiding travel. There is no date set for a physical conference, and a WordCamp Biratnagar 2021 event is unlikely. The organizing team may not be able to grant a scholarship until next year at the earliest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Biratnagar lead organizer Ganga Kafle said they are just waiting for the situation to return to normal but cannot be sure when that will happen. While there is no date for the next WordCamp, they are still holding regular meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group is still discussing the details of the scholarship. Currently, they plan to consult with other community groups within Nepal and the global community. Any help creating and maintaining such a scholarship system would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Biratnagar team did agree to some guidelines. Once submissions open, applicants must be Nepalese. &ldquo;We believe that empowering community members is an excellent way to honor his memory and carry on his legacy,&rdquo; wrote the team in its announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group leaders mostly agreed to award the scholarship to those meeting the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with disabilities.</li><li>People from lower-income families.</li><li>Women interested in WordPress.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The group said the selection process would be completely transparent, and the awarded scholarship would be at the discretion of the current WordCamp Biratnagar organizers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kafle said the scholarship would also be annual. The team plans to keep this going in honor of Thapa and paying respect to the man who helped jump-start many of their careers and involvement with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 23:25:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11387:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

The checklist is still applicable to all meetup groups but in places where vaccines are freely available, meetup organizers can now forego its requirements if they limit gatherings to those self-reporting as fully vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Andrea Middleton <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-discusses-adding-vaccination-status-to-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist\">proposed adding vaccination status</a> to the checklist in mid-May, the idea was met with a wide range of concerns and strong opinions. WordPress&rsquo; global community has experienced the pandemic in different ways, living under a spectrum of local restrictions, with disparate access to vaccines and varying responses to available vaccines. Some participants in the discussions were concerned about organizers having to request information about vaccination status from attendees, which is illegal in many places. Middleton clarified that attendance would be based on the honor system, and organizers would not be requesting any health information from individuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The WordPress community team is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;expecting or requiring local organizers to organize in-person events for fully-vaccinated people &mdash; we&rsquo;re simply removing the barrier to doing so,&rdquo; she said. The decision <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/01/in-person-meetup-events-for-vaccinated-community-members/\">announcement</a> includes a flow chart for the conditions that are now in place:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Middleton characterized the proposal as contentious and something that may be an unpopular decision. Participants in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/05/12/proposal-adding-vaccination-status-to-the-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist/\">discussion</a> got heated in expressing their opinions, which varied greatly based on each person&rsquo;s unique pandemic experiences and convictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some think it overstepping to prohibit unvaccinated people from attending meetups, others think only allowing vaccinated attendees would create a &ldquo;two-tiered&rdquo; meetup program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This proposal means that multiple groups of people will no longer be allowed to attend our meetings,&rdquo; Taco Verdonschot commented. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re limited to the meetings that are streamed online. They&rsquo;re basically second class citizens in our community now. They can&rsquo;t join the party, they have to watch through the window. Just this idea makes me extremely uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verdonschot cited several examples of people who might be excluded by the proposal to restart meetups for vaccinated attendees:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with a low income in areas where the vaccines aren&rsquo;t provided for free</li><li>Younger people in countries where vaccinations are administered to the elderly first, and only slowly make their way to the younger generations (like The Netherlands)</li><li>People who cannot get a vaccination for medical reasons, for example, because of known allergic reactions to vaccinations</li><li>Pregnant women</li><li>People with a limited immune system</li><li>People whose religion doesn&rsquo;t allow them to get vaccinated</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I realize there are some on the team who do not agree, and I hope that these guidelines are flexible enough that you are able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit\">disagree and commit</a>&nbsp;in this case,&rdquo; Middleton said in the decision announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While I agree that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time when fully-vaxxed-only meetups are a thing of the past, I do think it&rsquo;s important to make that possible for our communities.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 02:52:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Automattic Releases Sketch Block for Drawing in the WordPress Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:201:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3872:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Automattic released a new plugin titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sketch/\">Sketch Block</a> earlier today. It is a one-off block that allows end-users to draw directly in the editor. The plugin is marked as a beta release and requires Gutenberg to be activated to use. It is a part of the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments/tree/master/blocks/sketch\">Block Experiments project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be perfectly honest, I spent an excessive amount of time playing around with this block plugin today. And, if I am going overboard with that honesty, most of that time was just trying to write out my name. It was hard not to. Drawing things directly in the editor is just kind of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Attempts to write my name with Sketch Block.\n\n\n\n<p>I am unsure how many practical uses the plugin actually has at its current stage, but not everything needs a purpose outside of pure entertainment. Like an embedded <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-a-saurus-embeds-a-side-scrolling-t-rex-game-via-the-block-editor\">Block-a-saurus game</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">ghost-written headings</a>, sometimes we just need reminders about the wild and whacky side of the web. We also need to experiment with new ideas from time to time, which can lead to unexpected discoveries, creating the foundation of future technological advancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we just need to relieve some stress and sketch out our names in a new tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the block using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad &mdash; not an ideal method for freehand drawing. Unfortunately, I did not have access to a larger touchscreen device for a more thorough test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block offers a limited number of controls as of version 1.0.7. Users can select between three different stroke widths and choose from their theme&rsquo;s color palette. The block&rsquo;s height can be resized, but there seems to be a minimum of 200px.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did manage to break it a few times, running into the &ldquo;This block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed&rdquo; error. There also seemed to be an unknown minimum width, which could not be adjusted. My goal was to create a columnized team page with each member&rsquo;s signature beneath their profile photo. However, the Sketch block kept breaking outside of my columns. In the end, I created a single-member bio section:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a profile card with Sketch Block\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the <a href=\"https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand\">Perfect Freehand</a> JavaScript library. When comparing Automattic&rsquo;s block implementation to the <a href=\"https://perfect-freehand-example.vercel.app/\">library&rsquo;s demo</a>, the plugin falls short of offering the same experience in block form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect Freehand&rsquo;s demo felt smoother. I was able to consistently draw with more accuracy using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad. I do not know if just the size of the drawing area made a difference or if the editor interfered with the feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Drawing in the Perfect Freehand demo.\n\n\n\n<p>The JavaScript library has a ton of extra options too. Users can transform even the worst drawing into something a bit cleaner with the thinning, smoothing, streamline, and other controls. I would love to see the Sketch Block plugin integrate the full suite of tools available through Perfect Freehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few bumps, the plugin is a solid first release for a beta project. I am eagerly waiting for what future versions have in store. I also wonder what applications it might have outside of piddling around for fun, such as notetaking or animations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 01:50:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Gatsby WP Themes Launches New Marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=116788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2861:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://gatsbywpthemes.com/\">Gatsby WP Themes</a> project has launched a new marketplace for developers who are building WordPress-powered sites with Gatsby on the frontend. Originally founded by Zac Gordon and Alexandra Spalato, the commercial venture is now primarily managed by Spalato and Paulina Hetman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s first project involved <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wordpress-themes-project-partners-with-theme-shops-to-port-popular-themes-to-gatsby\">porting the Twenty Twenty WordPress Theme</a> to a Gatsby WP Theme. They are now focused on creating commercial themes targeted at developers and agencies who can use them to save time when building clients&rsquo; sites. Gatsby is more well-suited to sites that don&rsquo;t have a lot of dynamic content, such as marketing or documentation sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby WP Themes is launching with several starter themes with different styles for each child theme. They include designs suitable for blogs, personal sites, businesses, restaurants, and portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby themes have several distinct advantages over just grabbing a starter or boilerplate Gatsby site from GitHub. Spaloto identified a few reasons why developers might opt for using a theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gatsby themes allow Gatsby site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for reuse.</li><li>All of your default configuration lives in an npm package.</li><li>Themes are versioned packages that can be updated like any other package.</li><li>If you created multiple sites using the same theme, you can just update the central theme to push changes across all of them.</li><li>Themes are composable: You can install a blog theme alongside a notes theme, alongside an e-commerce theme (and so forth).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All themes in the new Gatsby WP Themes marketplace include built-in support for dynamic comments, search, Mailchimp integration, sitemaps, Google analytics or Google Tag Manager, and various widgets. The marketplace also includes Gatsby plugins that make popular WordPress plugins more compatible with Gatsby frontends.

It has been a slow process as I have patiently waited for the feature to mature into a powerful tool for end-users. I am still as much a believer now as I was then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is betting big on patterns too. The feature is now a top-level <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33094\">site-editing component</a> with several sub-features under development. As Gutenberg project lead Matias Ventura noted, &ldquo;From directory browsing to placeholder setup to transformations, patterns are crucial component of the entire site editing scope.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, patterns were just an idea, almost a footnote compared to other upcoming features. Since WordPress 5.5 included the Patterns API for developers, over 100 themes in the official directory bundle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new pattern directory is launching on WordPress.org next month alongside the version 5.8 release. There are already over 30 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">community-contributed patterns</a> approved. More are likely to land in the coming weeks. The directory will also eventually be open to anyone who wants to submit new designs. Any WordPress user will have the choice to select from this collection directly from their WordPress admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ideas are just scratching the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the block patterns feature is a simple way of bundling one or more blocks into a preconfigured design. Users can point and click to insert them into their post or page content. The goal of the block system is not just to be a page builder where users must create everything from scratch. While we want it to be flexible enough to do that, most users should have the ability to simply insert sections of a design and customize them. This could be as simple as an audio player with a background to a portfolio layout that showcases their latest projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the user experience is only set up to handle a dozen or patterns at a time &mdash; too many choices can be a less-than-ideal adventure. As the library grows, the interface will need to evolve with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How can we build experiences on top of this foundation that mitigates some of the complexity?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg development team is already working on multiple solutions, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28736\">contextual suggestions</a> for a selected block. However, one of the more promising features is patterns registered for specific block types. In this case, template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a user wants to select a new pattern for the header of their website, they should not have to sort through every option to find something. With Header patterns, the editor presents the user with a carousel of choices to scroll through specific to that template part.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Scrolling through header patterns.\n\n\n\n<p>This same feature is possible with footers too:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a footer pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been beta testing WordPress 5.8 or running the Gutenberg plugin in the last few months may have noticed some similarities to the Query Loop block (formerly named Query). It is the same underlying system that allows developers to attach patterns to a specific block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can already select from multiple Query Loop patterns when first inserting the block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a Query Loop pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Recent improvements to the Template Part and Query Loop blocks has opened up a whole new world for how patterns can be used,&rdquo; wrote Kjell Reigstad in a recent <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/25/theme-patterns-for-the-site-editor/\">ThemeShaper blog post</a>. &ldquo;Both blocks can now display a carousel of block patterns in their setup state, allowing users to choose between a menu of pre-designed versions of these blocks. These patterns can be bundled with your theme, so that users have a wide range of pre-designed header, query, and footer options available to choose from in the Site Editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31610\">open ticket</a> for several core header and footer patterns. The following is a short video clip of how this works:</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As any theme developer knows, you cannot simply plop anything into the header and make it look good. It is one of the most specialized areas of theme design. One wrong turn and the entire design falls apart. The downside to this feature will be third-party patterns coming from the directory. Some will work. Others will not fit into every theme design, but they are not necessarily meant to. It could be a support nightmare for theme authors or an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers will be able to steer their own ship, offering a range of choices that are perfectly molded to their designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I can already see it&hellip;multipurpose themes with 50+ header patterns listed in their marketing material.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is unlikely that many people had this in mind during the conceptual stages of block patterns, they are evolving. They will be more than just something users can stick into their post content at random. They are that semi-controlled experience that will give users the flexibility of choice, but the theme serves as a guide for making intelligent decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a theme author offers four or five well-designed Header or Footer template patterns, users are more likely to select from those. It is easier than building from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a system also opens more <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-system-will-create-more-commercial-opportunities-for-wordpress-theme-authors\">commercial opportunities</a>. Imagine upselling specialized pattern collections for niches. A restaurant site header might want to focus on an &ldquo;order online&rdquo; button. A news website could feature a &ldquo;latest stories&rdquo; ticker above the site title and navigation. There are endless ideas, all awaiting a savvy theme developer to implement and monetize them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I am eager to see where patterns go. They are still the most exciting WordPress feature, offering the API that theme authors have needed for the past decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 02:06:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Makes Local Pro Free for All Users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119329\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:153:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3025:\"<p>WP Engine <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-supercharges-wordpress-development-local-pro-free-for-everyone/?utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_source=twitter\">announced</a> today that Local Pro, the commercial upgrade for its local WordPress development product, is now free for all users.

Shortly after, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-comment-block/\">Markdown Comment Block</a> plugin appeared on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is a one-off block. It allows users to enter notes directly into the post editor that will not appear on the front end of the site. Tabor said he came up with the idea when working on an article for building single-block plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few things I love more than simple plugins with a tight focus, performing a single function. Markdown Comment Block lands in this category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin creates a new block that works nearly the same as a typical Paragraph block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding inline comments to a post.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can change the text color, but they will not have access to the typical Rich Text controls. Those should be unnecessary anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who does long-form writing almost exclusively in Markdown, the block&rsquo;s use of the double percent-sign syntax for comments intrigued me. Technically, the Markdown spec does not support any sort of special characters for them. It handles HTML comments. However, those appear in the source code on the front end when the document is rendered. I have only seen the <code>%%</code> mark to denote comments in the <a href=\"https://www.inspire-writer.com/\">Inspire Writer</a> app for Windows. Tabor said he had seen the same in <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>. The feature also exists in the <a href=\"https://useiceberg.com/\">Iceberg editor</a> for WordPress, which Tabor created alongside Jeffrey Carandang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also introduces the <code>%%</code> keyboard shortcut. Typing it directly in the editor will create a new Markdown Comment block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary use case for the plugin would be leaving notes for my later self. However, it could also be handy in users&rsquo; publishing flows. The block adds a &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button to the toolbar. Clicking it deletes the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Clicking the &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button will delete the block.\n\n\n\n<p>The block itself will not likely offer a robust enough feature set for complex workflows. However, pairing it with a plugin like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upgrade-your-publishing-flow-with-the-post-descriptions-wordpress-plugin\">Post Descriptions</a> could round out the experience for larger teams of writers and copyeditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Post Descriptions plugin allows users to add notes on the post level. These notes appear on the post-management screen, letting other team members know when to check an article. However, it may be hard to provide the full context of what issues need to be resolved before publishing. Markdown Comment Block adds an inline comments system, letting team members pass in-text notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers should appreciate that the block uses CSS custom properties too, which makes it easy to overwrite its default style rules.  In moments, I was able to make it match my theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom color, font, and line-height styles.\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>--markdown-comment-font-size</code>, <code>--markdown-comment-line-height</code>, and <code>--markdown-comment-color</code> variables are available for theme developers who want to add in support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one complaint I had about the block is its title: &ldquo;Comment.&rdquo; It is easy to confuse it with the six other comment-related blocks already in the WordPress block list. And, there will only be more in upcoming versions. Giving it a title of &ldquo;Markdown Comment&rdquo; would better distinguish it from others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:15:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 9.0 Scheduled for Short Development Cycle to Ship Block-Based Widgets Ahead of WordPress 5.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:271:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3801:\"<p><a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2021/06/buddypress-8-0-0-alfano/\">BuddyPress 8.0</a> was just released earlier this month on June 6, but the core development team is gearing up for a <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2021/06/24/bp-dev-chat-summary-june-23-2021/\">short development cycle for 9.0</a>. The release will be specifically targeted at getting BuddyPress core widgets ready for WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s new block widgets experience. Contributors are aiming to hit the following timeline to ship 9.0 before the next major WordPress release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Beta: July 8.</li><li>RC: July 12.</li><li>Final:&nbsp;<strong>July 16</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress entered the world of blocks with the release of version 6.0 in May 2020, allowing users to insert a specific Member or Group into content. Version 7.0, released six months later, introduced blocks for featuring a list of members, a list of groups, and the ability to embed a public activity post. Over the next few weeks, BuddyPress contributors will continue the process of <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-blocks/issues/37\">migrating the rest of the BuddyPress component widgets to blocks</a>. These include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Blogs Recent Posts Widget</strong>: A list of recently published posts from across the network</li><li><strong>BP Core Login Widget</strong>: Shows a Log In form to logged-out visitors, and a Log Out link to those who are logged in</li><li><strong>BP Core Friends Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest Friends of the displayed member. Widget is only shown when viewing a member profile</li><li><strong>BP Groups Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, newest, or alphabetical groups</li><li><strong>BP Core Members Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest members</li><li><strong>BP Core Recently Active Widget</strong>: Profile photos of recently active members</li><li><strong>BP Core Who&rsquo;s Online Widget</strong>: Profile photos of online users</li><li><strong>BP Messages Sitewide Notices Widget</strong>: Display Sitewide Notices posted by the site administrator</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BP Nouveau widgets:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>BP Latest Activities</strong>: Display the latest updates of your community having the types of your choice</li><li><strong>BP Nouveau Navigation Widget</strong>: Displays BuddyPress primary nav in the sidebar of the site. (Must be used as the first widget of the sidebar and only once.)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to building a block for every BuddyPress widget, contributors are aiming to make it possible to <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8496\">transform existing BP widgets into their corresponding BP block</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new block widgets screen imminently landing in WordPress, BuddyPress has to make this move forward to keep pace with the progress of the block editor&rsquo;s march beyond use in the content editor. Otherwise, BuddyPress users would need to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">disable block widgets with the Classic Widgets plugin</a> in order to maintain access to BuddyPress core widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are also working on creating a new Follow component, a frequently requested feature which would use the now abandoned <a href=\"https://github.com/r-a-y/buddypress-followers\">BuddyPress Follow</a> plugin as inspiration. The feature will work similar to Twitter following or the Facebook follow button that allows users to see public activity posts for those they are following. The Follow component is being built as a plugin first and will ship with 9.0 if it is ready in time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 01:07:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Diving Into WordPress 5.8’s New Widgets Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6657:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It has been a while since I have touched widgets. Once the site editor landed in the Gutenberg plugin, I almost exclusively dropped the old sidebar paradigm and moved to block templates. Reactivating old themes and jumping into the widgets screen felt like time-traveling into a bygone era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of being deeply embedded within block themes, it is hard to imagine moving back to the sidebar widgets system that most WordPress users are still using today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">WordPress 5.8 is slated to ship</a> with a small taste of bringing blocks outside of the content editor. However, it can feel like a surface-level refresh of a dying system, one that does not always work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based widgets are part of the transitional phase between classic WordPress and the future, which centers on a complete site editor. Once the bulk of themes are built atop blocks, the need for widgets will wane. The site editor and block themes do not support the old sidebar system. Instead, users will be able to place blocks anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last October, I asked the question: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/are-block-based-widgets-ready-to-land-in-wordpress-5-6\">Are Block-Based Widgets Ready To Land in WordPress 5.6?</a> At the time, the widgets screen was expected to launch with the final release of 2020. However, the development team pulled back on the feature&rsquo;s inclusion, primarily because the customizer implementation was sub-par.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the same question of WordPress 5.8, my answer is mostly the same. It is time to ship the current feature and prepare for a future without widgets. There are so many components that are far more exciting around the corner. The primary user-experience issues will linger around until users have moved on to block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have long been in the camp of starting from a clean slate for block themes, letting widgets die out. However, the path WordPress has chosen is to create this stepping stone for users who may be on traditional themes for a while. It provides an opportunity to use blocks outside of the editor, which may be a leap forward for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the vast number of libraries, one-off blocks, and support from plugin authors, users have a wealth of block choices at their fingertips. Right now, if there is no equivalent widget, those users can only ever use those blocks in their content. Within a block-widget system, that limitation does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also lifts some burdens from developers. Those who want to shed some of their old code and go all-in on blocks can begin considering deprecating or retiring widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitioning to the new Widgets screen should feel simple to users familiar with the WordPress content editor. Inserting blocks is the same. The difference is that each sidebar has its own container.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Widgets screen with a Gallery block in the Footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>The range of blocks within core WordPress could also let users drop some of their widgets-based plugins. One of the most popular types of widgets over the years has been for handling post lists. There are dozens of such plugins and an untold number of themes that include one. Coupled with WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s Query Loop block, users can now recreate many of those widgets themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom post list using the Query Loop block.\n\n\n\n<p>Much of this depends on the theme&rsquo;s design support of blocks and whether it will accommodate anything other than traditional widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customizer support for block widgets is lightyears ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging. While it was a remarkable programming feat to make the two features work together, the user experiences are nearly a decade apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editing a Heading block in the customizer.\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the customizer providing a live preview, the Widgets screen in the WordPress admin gives the necessary workspace. Trying to squeeze the block editor into the tiny customize controls panel was never going to be an ideal experience, and it still is not. It gets the job done, but I recommend the traditional widgets screen for fewer headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Problems Remain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the eight months since I first dived into the block-based widgets, the system has been overhauled. However, the potential issues I brought up remain. Just dropping blocks into a sidebar can have mixed results. For example, compare a Legacy Widget to Heading and Latest Comments blocks in the footer sidebar of the popular OceanWP theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Mismatched headings and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>The issue is that WordPress treats every block as a widget. Traditionally, widgets have had both a title and content. Blocks have no such concept. A Heading followed by something like a Paragraph, Latest Comments, or another block has no special meaning in the block system. They are all treated separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is in full view when adding blocks to the default Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block treated as widget in Twenty Twenty-One footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the Heading and Latest Comments blocks are columnized because they are seen as separate widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, users must add multiple blocks into a Group block if they want them treated as a single &ldquo;widget.&rdquo; It is a simple matter, but it could still be a usability hurdle for some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a fix in place, there is no guarantee that blocks will appear as the widgets the theme author intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I long ago gave up on the hope that there would be better handling for block widgets. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">Classic Widgets plugin</a> is available for those who need it, and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/opting-out/#using-remove_theme_support\">theme authors can opt-out</a>. These are necessary tools for an experience that can range from downright awesome to utterly broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing blocks outside of the content editor for traditional theme users is probably necessary for the transition, but the current site editor experience already feels much smoother than block widgets. The long-term focus should be on moving away from the dated concept of widgets and into a WordPress front-end 100% built on blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 23:52:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Gutenberg Times: Theme.json Resources, Block Patterns and WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-json-resources-block-patterns-and-wordpress-5-8-weekend-edition-175/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13004:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enjoy cooling off at the community pool after our lunch walks.

The webinar is now live and welcome to our 28th Gutenberg live Q and A on this June 24th. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I am your host for today&#8217;s discussion. Thank you all for watching, and it&#8217;s great to have you. And while you all come in, use the chat window to tell us where you are and where you&#8217;re watching from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today we will discuss a new way to configure themes, that is black themes, with global styles and settings file theme.json. And it will enable theme developers to centralize all the block-based settings, color palettes, font sizes, and other block-based customizations. This way you will also control which of the other block features the theme supports or does not support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s my simple mind&#8217;s description of the new features and I&#8217;m so thrilled to have three experts on the show to go beyond this simple explanation and help theme developers to get started. I&#8217;m extremely honored to have Daisy Olsen, developer advocate at Automatic and WordPress contributor. Hey, good to have you. Also Jeff Ong, code wrangler at Automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong: </em>Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thanks for being here. And at last but not at least Tammie Lister, design lead at Extendify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We&#8217;ll do some proper introduction in less than a minute. I just have a few housekeeping notes. So after the introduction, we&#8217;ll have a first round robin question and then we see a demo. Jeff was working really hard on it and I think he was the only one repairing hard for this live Q and A. And then we&#8217;ll discuss the different angles and how they get started. And then, of course, answer your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of questions, how do you pose your questions? There&#8217;s a Q and A on the bottom of the screen, a kind of icon. You click on that and write your question. And for those watching on YouTube use the chat window next to the video player. And so saying hi. Hi, Victor. From Buenos Aires in Argentina. Awesome. Thank you for being here. All right. When you do comments and questions, so please be kind even if you disagree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a family endeavor. All right. Well, I&#8217;m thrilled you all agreed dear panelists to come on the show and I get an hour to talk with you about your work. So, Daisy, tell us a little bit about you, where are you&#8217;re located and what is it that you do as developer advocate on the purpose project and at Automatic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen and I live in New Hampshire in the United States. It&#8217;s a beautiful day here right now unlike some parts of this country that are really hot. We got the cool weather over here this week. So as a developer advocate, I talk about WordPress a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get out and do workshops, teach classes, write documentation and just stay involved and close to the projects development so that I know what&#8217;s going on theoretically and can share that out particularly with plugin and theme developers as well as agencies and freelancers and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. So glad you&#8217;re here. Thank you. So, Tammie, thank you for coming back to the show. It&#8217;s been over three years. The last time you were on the show was just after Gutenberg was merged into Core and you were one of the three leads with Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you shared a lot about the journey of Gutenberg and the philosophy behind it. So I will put the link to the show into the show notes for you who have been coming later to Gutenberg. But this year you joined the WordPress product company Extendify. So what do you do there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> First of all, has it been three years? That goodness. Time flies. So in Extendify I focus on design. So our solutions extend the editor. And then the aim is to make it even more usable for people&#8217;s purpose that they want to use it for. And I&#8217;m really, really excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it means that people can have the best experience from the content they&#8217;re creating, to the layout, the patterns, the styles, whatever that the editor enables, that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m focusing on. So it&#8217;s a interesting new challenge to do. And you have blew my brain with that time span. You really have. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s also over three years that Gutenberg times us. So I&#8217;ve been part of that journey so for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Congrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nothing really held my attention for so long. And normally I get really bored. Well, I&#8217;m also really happy that Extendify took over <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorplus/\">Editor Plus</a> from Munir Kumal and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> from Jeffrey Carandang. So, those have a more sustainable way now to access because both Munir and Jeffrey seem to have&#8230; Munir joined you, but Jeffrey moved on to be a consultant at , I think, 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> It&#8217;s so really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I imagine. So thank you also to Jeff Ong for joining us today as well. You&#8217;re a code wrangler in Automatic and what have you been working on lately except for the demo. I know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong</em>: Well, first, thank you for having me and hosting this. Awesome to be here. I feel very honored to be with three on-time contributors. So super cool. At Automattic, I&#8217;ve been working on theme development, pretty solely focused on that for the last year. And my background is not in WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of been an interesting journey to transition and learn about the ecosystem and really coming at a transitory time figuring out how do we kind of move into this new block-based paradigm? How do we make themes that work with the block editor really well and can hopefully unlock more creativity for just really great design. And I can tell you what sites again. Well, making new themes and figuring out how to do that with the latest version of Gutenberg, which turns out every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So the viewers follow Jeff Ong, he&#8217;s going to teach you how to do things with the Block Editor. And we will soon see a little demo of that. It&#8217;s what Daisy said, &#8220;What you did in five minutes, I taught a course on that in three hours.&#8221; So it&#8217;s going to be a little fast paced today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-strong-what-will-change-most-for-the-theme-developers-when-building-themes-for-full-site-editing-strong\">What will change most for the theme developers when building themes for full-site editing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we head into media&#8217;s raised, I would like to ask each of you, so what do you think will change most for the theme developers when building themes? These are for agency building custom themes for the clients or for theme shops rolling out new themes to sell. Do you want to start, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting because I think perhaps it&#8217;s a change if you wanted to be a change. Because lots of this is an opt-in, as is the way. WordPress, the best way to opt-in. I go back to a lot of times that this is a freeing of things and I think it brings an opportunity that has pros and cons, ups and downs with opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But plug-ins themes no longer have to pretend that they&#8217;re plugins and they no longer have to be everything and have to be things that they weren&#8217;t intended to be in the first. So I think that that is a challenge in itself because there&#8217;s a certain way that you maybe thought you had to do things and now you don&#8217;t have to work around things. We often have to work around things in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have to work around it, it can feel a little bit peculiar, but once you realize you don&#8217;t have to do that, it&#8217;s actually really awesome. But you have to realize you don&#8217;t have to and that WordPress was getting in the way. I also think as a result there&#8217;s going to be a space for more creativity, and this can also be really to challenging because maybe you were limited to what you could do creativity wise because of just the confinements of the space and the confinements of what you could do before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to open things again to a lot more people. And a lot more people who maybe didn&#8217;t have access to a theme developer with experience who knew the exact ins and outs of it. So I think that&#8217;s a challenge because new people in this space, new creativity. But honestly I think it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s just if you want to and you&#8217;re open to it and you can kind of explore those new ways, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a change that you have to make. I think that&#8217;s the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you. Daisy, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So I think I would agree with Tammie that the barrier of entry for a new theme designer. And I think that&#8217;s one of the key things is it&#8217;s bringing the design back to theming. Theming over time became very functional. We had a lot of theme companies that were trying to make their themes as flexible, powerful and feature-ful as possible to reach a wide variety of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that we can see some opportunity for vertically oriented designs coming out where you have a theme that is geared towards a restaurant or geared towards, I don&#8217;t know, a salon or a certain kind of a business or even a personal site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to be able to have a lot of variety out there in the marketplace so that when someone asks you inevitable question, because this was probably the most common question when I was working for a thing company is which theme is best for this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m doing this kind of a site, which themes should I use. And it could make it so, well, here are five that are really geared towards what you&#8217;re trying to do instead of, oh, you can use any of them. You just have to do all this work to get it to look bright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point. Thank you. Jeff?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Definitely, from a design perspective, it&#8217;s super exciting. I want to highlight maybe a little bit more from the development side. This seems like the biggest opportunity or clearest opportunity to ensure that your theme is integrated with the editor. That the things that you&#8217;re doing with the editor and your ability to customize it to control what presets and options are available there to the users of the theme, this is the theme [inaudible 00:12:27].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a unifying kind of idea and single point of truth. Talking about theme.json and even just this whole concept of how do we bring the experience together. I think we have an opportunity to do that and that&#8217;s going to change even in some small level. Even if your theme.json cloud just as a few settings. You can take it slow like Tammie was saying. Incorporate parts of it because to me you have this new contract now that can really unify things and bring things together from a lot of disparate parts and pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Lots to think about. And I agree with all of you. I had this pleasure last year that I took over themes from agencies and they were so powerful and all the things that normally a plug-in will do, custom post types and rigid and all that. It&#8217;s all in one place and we won&#8217;t be able to change a theme at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now this is definitely going to make life a lot easier for site owners as well So lots to think about and listening to you is quite inspiring to kind of think, oh, well how many direction can my brain go now? But, Jeff, are you ready for your demo? I think it would be helpful for all the people here on the call to see what it&#8217;s all about and how it kind of gets started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yes. We have 10 minutes roughly. Yes. Can you see my screen? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We can see your screen. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-demo-configuring-the-block-editor-with-theme-json-file\">Demo: Configuring the block editor with theme.json file</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwhHKKblhU&t=18s\">14.02</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: So we have a blank theme here and I just want to kind of go over some, not going to cover everything, but some of the key parts of that theme.json introduces and show how that impacts a blank theme and also the editor. So hopping over to my code editor. I have my theme.JSON here. This is a really basic, simple theme and nothing going on yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In here I&#8217;m going to go ahead and the first thing I want to talk about are the settings of your theme.JSON. Settings are kind of what control or give you the ability to configure the editor and what kind of customization options are present to a user and the theme. The only thing I have right now is the layout, which we&#8217;ll get to in a second. But let&#8217;s say I want to add some color options here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously it would be done in the functions PHP. I have kind of a few sheets over here. Sorry. I need to hide these meeting control. I&#8217;m going to copy a color palette from this. I&#8217;m going to set a palette that&#8217;s going to become available to me in my theme. I go to edit the same post. In here I see my cornso, my orange, red, and color blue that&#8217;s become available to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s pretty interesting about this is before you would have had to kind of go into functions at this whole palette and then also define the class name, something like this to actually apply those styles. Let&#8217;s say I want this heading to be orange, update it. Show it here. I get all this cool stuff for free. This class was generated for me by Gutenberg using this preset and that I have defined meeting controls defined here in my palette options.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool thing or interesting about the possibility here is within the same configuration. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m the theme designer. I have the option right now to change the color to kind of anything I want. The powerful thing about theme.json at this time is it can actually turn something like this off. I actually don&#8217;t want people or my users to be able to change anything, change the color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s go ahead and reset this back here. Turned off custom colors within theme.json. And then back here you&#8217;ll see that option has disappeared. So inaccessible color combinations or just color combinations that you don&#8217;t want to be available. You can turn that off. This is just one of the options that are available. Color is just one of the options that you can customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take a look at something like typography. I think I can find some font sizes here. Refresh. I can see now that those presets were available, are now available to me. I can do the same thing again here too. Say I don&#8217;t actually want people to be able to change all sides here. As a designer I know it&#8217;s best and I don&#8217;t want people putting in random font sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So disable that and now only my presets are available too. Oh, by the way, this content is just kind of some standard block-based content. Again, I&#8217;m getting all of this kind of for free or for free in a way by just applying some preset values here. Well, I think the next thing that I wanted to cover is going into the last thing. I&#8217;ll cover it within the settings because you can actually change these per block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we were looking at color before. I could add a color key to the paragraph block and actually say, just kidding. I want to allow you to be able to change the color of paragraph blocks. Just the paragraph blocks. I can open up the whole thing. So within here now I can see, oh, I can actually change just for paragraph blocks. I go up to my heading. This custom color is not available. This color option is not available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to I could also supply a custom palette. I&#8217;m not going to do that, but could say if you wanted a specific palette that&#8217;s just applied for paragraph blocks. That would be how you do it. So I think that&#8217;s it for settings. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and collapse this now and move on to the styles key of our theme.json. And now within here I can start to define some files.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember our colors from up here from the palette. I can go ahead and because I know that WordPress is generating CSS variables based on these palettes, I can go ahead and start to use those within the styles application of the style section of my theme.json. So with the preset color, put orange red. See what else do. These are going to apply at the top level. So this is going to apply to everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I only wanted, for instance, my headings to be&#8230; Let&#8217;s make this. Do the same thing in here and say, ah, I just want, actually, let&#8217;s just make my paragraph colors black. So, again, what I&#8217;ve done here is I&#8217;ve set my global kind of text color to this orange red was preset, which was provided by WordPress and generated here to the entire text. And then actually I can go in and target specific block, set the settings for that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we are close. I just want to show, well, if you&#8217;re editing this, something that&#8217;s also probably going to happen and mess this up. It should throw some kind of an error here yet. Notice there when decoding theme.json. So that&#8217;ll let you know there&#8217;s something going on because it&#8217;s pretty easy tip something up here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just a small note is we&#8217;ll likely encounter that if you&#8217;re configuring keys and nested objects trying to figure out how each of those apply. You pause here for a second. I guess the last thing I want to cover too is the concept of elements. So within here, any h2 that I have is going to be applied a specific style here. So I have the same because [inaudible 00:24:24] can appear outside of blocks or links, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are restricted to a specific set at the moment. So let&#8217;s just say text. So, again, because this is not actually rendered as a pocket and an element and that can appear anywhere. That&#8217;s something that I can target with this kind of top level elements select here. Everything else here you can target with the name of the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is most of what I wanted to cover pretty fast, but again all of the settings that you can find here or that I&#8217;m going over, there&#8217;s way more than just color. There&#8217;s spacing, typography and all of that can be found in documentation that Birgit, I think she shared it here. So that I want to open it up. And I guess there are questions. If there are specific parts that anyone would want to go into in a little more detail. Happy to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Thank you, Jeff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Thank you, Jeff. This was awesome. Do you want to just say something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I just wanted to say that maybe we could just talk about layout real quick because I think that&#8217;s going to be a big one for 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And I kind of skipped over. It was the first thing that was in here. Yes. Layout key is a way for you to quickly define the default, the width of your content within WordPress or within here. So if you see here, if I don&#8217;t define this layout, a lot of my content is just going to be full width by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can supply two values here. Content size, it&#8217;s just going to be the default width. You can also define, I think it&#8217;s, what is it? Wide size. Wide width. Nothing happened there because I hadn&#8217;t provided it. Maybe there&#8217;s a better way to show that with cover block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Nice. I like it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Pretty cool. You can, I mean, alignment coming together and within a unified system reliably layout content with starting here is pretty powerful stuff I&#8217;d say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Awesome. So I shared in the chat window, if you haven&#8217;t seen it, the documentation link where you can read up about the theme.json as a whole. When you say, Daisy, that that&#8217;s the layout will be important for 5.8, which part of it would be, where does it come into play?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> So with 5.8 with the custom template functionality that&#8217;s coming where you can basically create a custom template for an entire page or a post that would cover your header as well as your content. If you need to have these setting set for the width, especially the content size for it but preferably also wide so that your site knows how wide it should be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise you get kind of the facts that Jeff showed where it was the full width of the page. It didn&#8217;t have anything to contain it down to the width that you want. So for any theme that wants to use the template editor would benefit from having a theme.json file that even if it only has the one thing in it, it would be good way to take advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s an excellent tip. Thank you, Daisy. You heard it here first. So we already got some questions in our Q and A, but I just wanted to have one question for Jeff before. That&#8217;s my prerogative as a host, I get the first question. So if I understood it correctly, so until now, theme.json comes into play I had to create many different places or touch many different places to make a color palette work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I had to put it in my functions.php and then I also have to put it in my style sheet. Is [inaudible 00:30:04] that I don&#8217;t have to do this anymore, or do I still have to put it into my style sheet, or is it automatically created with when I put the color palette in the theme.json?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> It is wonderful question. It is automatically created. This is all that that style sheet looks like since this is one of the big very exciting aspects of a theme.json. It&#8217;s that it&#8217;s managing this for you. And then also I think more down the line by providing colors and styles in this way. And then also by applying the styles here you can guarantee that those blocks are going to integrate properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like the styles for those blocks are going to be more closely tied and actually in how the block is implemented. So no more writing styles that are overwriting that we&#8217;re having to target specific nested blocks. And so there&#8217;s tons of complications to this and there&#8217;s a lot more room to mature and develop, but I think that&#8217;s one of the parts I&#8217;m most excited about. To your point, there&#8217;s one place now where I can define my palette and show how it should be applied. I don&#8217;t have to go into two different places to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, let&#8217;s go to the questions. Victor Kane, from the beginning of the show has already put them in and he&#8217;s particular interested in finding out about the workflow using them theme.json. So one is the best editing alternative for VS Code formatting, and then the second one was the possibility for exporting interactive selections to clipboard and code. I&#8217;m not quite sure I understand the question. Maybe you understand it, Jeff Daisy, Tammie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Personally. So I think this is a personal choice. I&#8217;m going to start with an answer and then go to&#8230; I use VS Code, so I may not be able to give the right answer there. I would be curious to know what you don&#8217;t want in VS Code, and I think that that&#8217;s the thing. This opens up personal&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be really bad at reading the response in chat whilst talking. So I&#8217;m going to be a little bit pertinent and kind of speak first. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll get back to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s your personal choice how you write and then you can kind of go back to it. So the thing that I did, this was my workflow, it has been my workflow so far, and I think this is the thing, we&#8217;re all finding our own new workflows with these new toys that we&#8217;re playing with. So what I&#8217;ve been doing is I&#8217;ve been using theme.json.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been setting up variables using SAS that have been then pulling in root variables into my theme.json so that I can pull them through. That&#8217;s a weird way to do it. That&#8217;s strange, but the reason being, it means I can reuse and keep things separately. But I&#8217;m sure that everybody on this call has their own little workflows that they are kind of working from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> My approach to that was actually the opposite that I was using my theme.json to set all of my variables so that I didn&#8217;t need SAS, which I think for those that never quite got their head wrapped around preprocessed CSS, it might be a way to simplify things for those that prefer it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>I think it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re cozy with, right? And I think that&#8217;s the thing. This can adapt to what was your cozy blanket of coding, and you don&#8217;t have to lose that yet, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. So Victor commented on that. If I get the results, I want interactively with the global settings panel on the right-hand side of the editor, can I export that to a theme.json format?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>The answer is not right now. I think there&#8217;s discussion in the teams about maybe building it, but it hasn&#8217;t been the highest priority because everything needs to work first before we start working on an exporter. But there are other parts of that can be exported in that full site editing experience that can be exported. So I think it would be a natural progression to add the ability to do a theme.json export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Definitely there will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> From the very beginning, there were designs in global style. Sorry. The reason I know is that was one thing I did partake on. There was exporting. So I have a feeling if we all wanted to play some little happy bets, there will be exploiting at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. But if we all bet on the same thing, it&#8217;s not really bet, right? Victor, as always, you&#8217;re a little bit ahead of the time. So and from Jan Horna, from the Czech Republic, it&#8217;s very hot by now there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has two questions as a theme developer, one, is the theme.json supposed to include all the styling, formatting definitions and replaced the CSS style? And I think we&#8217;d take it one at a time. So we talked a little bit about it from my question, but would it replace? You could still do all those styling in the style sheets as you want, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> And I think there are some things that will remain in other styling, but you could use the variables that you set or the properties that you set in your theme.json in your CSS. So they can work together. But I don&#8217;t think that theme.json, at least right now, will not completely replace an entire site&#8217;s design, especially if you have a very complex design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-meta-charset-utf-8-why-do-we-want-to-rewrite-css-in-json\">Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And this was one of my first questions and honestly, skepticism early on of the proposal around this, is CSS is great. Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON. And then it slowly, I mean, other people are obviously smarter than me understood this quickly. It&#8217;s not about rewriting all of CSS. There&#8217;s definitely going to be aspects of your site, especially if you have taking, like you&#8217;re saying, more complicated designs that will remain in CSS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is about creating, I think, more of the foundational elements and understanding how the blocks will interact with your styles and having that single point of contact, I think is most important. So I think for me, at least it&#8217;s more about the foundational elements that are going to be placed and managed this way than replacing your entirety of your styles. Because this great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like animations and transformation, and this is all really powerful stuff that I don&#8217;t imagine, really, at least in the super near future, having a big part of theme.json. To the question about, will you be able to save an export a theme.json from global styles? I think this is a really important thing to keep in mind is what I just showed you is kind of unnatural. I don&#8217;t imagine a future necessarily where theme developers are writing raw JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really, there&#8217;s not a great experience for it. It&#8217;s a configuration file. And so the more, to points that have already been raised, it&#8217;s about we&#8217;re in this phase now because we need to kind of identify and get it to work, and then we can kind of build an ecosystem around what would a really cool UI look like to generate one of these files? Is it native directly to global styles? How do we start to imagine those interfaces so the theme developers or theme designers can really get to the core of this experience too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, thank you. Good point. You wanted to say something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>Yeah. I was just going to say over time, CSS has gained so much. So I didn&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I had a block.css file that was getting bigger and bigger of supporting blocks and doing things. And something I&#8217;ve noticed that I can do is throw that file away, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier because what I can do now is lean into these defaults. I&#8217;m still going to have some lines of CSS, the output by whatever, a preprocessor, whatever, my happy little whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because everyone has got their own way and we should have our own way of doing it. But it&#8217;s a foundation, and it means that we&#8217;re not having to work around the editor or find different ways of doing it. I set up naturally a hack file for the editor out of habit. I haven&#8217;t filled it with anything yet in the latest theme I&#8217;ve been working on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m delighted if I never fill that up with anything on the next theme, because it means that the new way we&#8217;re doing things hasn&#8217;t had me to work around that. I can just use the foundation and create a really awesome experience on top of it. And that&#8217;s what we should be doing. We should be working with the editor, not having to work around it, or using not important like it was going out of fashion to go over control of it. It was this awkward middle ground we were working in trying to make things fit that paradigm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I think that fits right into the next question from Jan Horna again, and he says so as a block theme developer, should I focus from a strategic point of view on theme.json block styles, or block patterns. In other words, how do I differentiate? It&#8217;s kind of a high-level question there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D<em>aisy Olsen: </em>I would say all of the above. They&#8217;re all important things. And your block styles are part of theme.json, I would say. But block patterns are really a powerful partner to the theme.json, that you can create building blocks for a site where you&#8217;ve got some really amazing very specific designed elements that could be used for different things on a site. So if you&#8217;re creating a commercial application that&#8217;s going to go out to a wide audience, they can be more generic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have a client and you&#8217;re working as a freelancer or in an agency where you have a site that needs to have access to these things that they&#8217;re going to use more than once, patterns are a fantastic way to do that, where most of the work is done for them. They don&#8217;t have to reconfigure everything from the ground up every time they want to create something similar to what they&#8217;ve done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-what-happens-when-you-update-the-color-palette-will-saved-blocks-have-the-new-colors\">What happens when you update the color palette? Will saved blocks have the new colors?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you. And Spencer McCormick in the chat had a question. So what happens when you update the color palette or similar, for example, if you have a primary and secondary colors, when you update and change the palette colors, will saved blocks have the new colors? That&#8217;s an interesting question. Thank you, Spenser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I can answer that to some extent. If you think of your palette as named colors, if you give the different hex code to the same name, it should apply to the site. But if you give it a new name, then that&#8217;s a new element, and it won&#8217;t apply to anything that already had an old name attached to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> There is a hefty discussion related to this question on the naming of colors in the way that Gutenberg wants to supply a default palette or a default set of named colors so that you could reliably&#8230; What we&#8217;re seeing I think is that I think patterns have been wanting to rely on specific colors across kind of, so you can guarantee oh, when corn flour shows up it&#8217;s always going to be corn flour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always going to be available. There&#8217;s a lot of complication and nuance around it. But if, I think today, to answer your question, like Daisy is saying, today, if I were to supply a value or a named value here and then change it or take it out of my palette, then that would break the experience or it would no longer be applied to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s part of the challenge, how do we reliably solve for that? How do we give theme office the tools to figure that out. But now if they set a custom color, if you set a custom color on an element or a block, then that will remain because it&#8217;s a specific X value, but the class names will go away though, if they&#8217;re supplied by the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So great discussions. And I&#8217;m probably going to share, and if it&#8217;s one issue where that discuss the theme team every week kind of shares all the things that are discussed and that need input from the community or other theme developers on their make blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a place to go to chime in and we&#8217;ll find all the discussions that are happening. And then chime in in the ones that you find important and that you are worried about. So Tim Bowen has the question, how does the theme.json handle responsive sizes for font sizes especially. Responsive sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>By default, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You&#8217;ve stomped the panelists. Yes, we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I mean, you can use not just pixel values for your fonts, so-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> That&#8217;s what I was going to say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: &#8230; that helps. And I think it&#8217;s a work in progress. So things like responsive and breakpoints. But the now answer is you don&#8217;t have to just use pixels. And Jeff just gave a great leak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je<em>ff Ong: </em>I just dropped the issue in that has not seen a lot of activity around it, but the idea of media. So the first part of your question on font sizes, there are ways of calculating this where they&#8217;re not pixel values tied to specific viewports. You could supply a calculated value, for example, in your small&#8230; that is based on a viewport size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a paradigm shift or design paradigm shift of getting away from you must be 12 pixels under below 600 pixel viewport width, to more of are we okay with kind of a fluid typography kind of system? That being said, there are instances where you need media queries, and that is not currently&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how actively that&#8217;s being worked on right now. But a wonderful thing open to contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So Patty has a comment and a question after that, Patty O&#8217;Hara, I most often develop custom themes for clients and hand them off for the clients to update the content. And playing around with new tools, I&#8217;m excited to start using them, but don&#8217;t want to give access to global standards to anyone with admin access. Will the granularity of permissions changes so that I can block access to changing fonts and colors from within the admin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think this amazing thing happens in where also Jeff showed some of the control you can do. So in the demo, there was some control that you can do. But my process is a history of configurability and being able to do that be it in code, or be it in a plugin. But I honestly think we need to be a little bit cautious. This is my personal opinion here, and we need to maybe embrace allowing people to do styling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set boundaries, you can set branding boundaries, you can set pallets, you can set topography. But we need to move away a little bit from having such pixel fixated control in that sense and think about safely within boundaries, expression of these tools. And that people can create really amazing things, and you can maintain branding that way, and it can empower someone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These themes are becoming style guides, and that&#8217;s something that is known in the corporate world and used within that space as well. It&#8217;s a term, but it&#8217;s kind of democratizing design in that sense in giving people all these tools to play with, and I think it&#8217;s a huge change in the way that we&#8217;ve done things, but I think it&#8217;s really, really important and really, really empowering to the people that are using our themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>That&#8217;s a good advocacy for set it free. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But you&#8217;re allowed to have boundaries. I think you can set it free, but be comfortable about some boundaries. I think sometimes when we say set it free, it can be scary because we don&#8217;t say you&#8217;re allowed to have some boundaries, but with pallets and with these style guides, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying. You&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m making these good decisions for you and you can choose from this platform of good decisions. And that&#8217;s kind of awesome. I think,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. I like the plea for block patterns that Daisy just a couple of minutes had that block patterns also give you the possibility or the option to actually provide different facets of how a section can be organized or styled within the style design system that you build with the block add on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that there is a lot of creativity that will come from that as well. So Tim Bowen is brave and contemplating, is it safe to use the theme.json now for a project launching in August? Would we just activate the Gutenberg plugin and add JSON file? Or is there more to it? I would love to move away from our functions in Editor.js method probably as soon as possible. So what would we say to Tim?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> The theme is not a block theme, as in it doesn&#8217;t use HTML templates, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t put the Gutenberg plugin on a production website, unless you are ready to deal with unexpected things happening. But placing your theme.json file in your classic theme on the 5.8 beta or release candidate that will be coming, I would start testing there and see if the things that you&#8217;re putting in your theme.json file work with 5.8 on a classic theme. That&#8217;d be my suggestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think if it&#8217;s launching in August, that means 5.8 should be out. She tries to check her mental calendar. So I think tests. I, personally, am okay. I would consider it if it was going into a site, but I would also want to know how many users were using it, what their levels was, what they were doing, what they were going to create, and how they were going to do it. So it&#8217;s a&#8230; this is not legal advice. I feel that there should be [inaudible 00:50:36] advice that I can be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Don&#8217;t try this at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But by then, 5.8 should be out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. 5.8 comes out July 20th, that&#8217;s at least the schedule for that. So we ran out of questions right now one the Q and A sessions here. Well, you&#8217;re welcome, Tim. Good luck with that, and let us know. Is there more to the setting it up besides just activating the plugin or adding the JSON file. Well, back to kind of using it and editing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When there are already themes available in the theme repository that use the full set up for full site editing and use all the template parts and templates with the blocks, and header blocks, and photo blocks, and all that. But I&#8217;m not quite sure of that yet. Be careful about the using the Gutenberg plugin in production. It always has a few hiccups there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it wasn&#8217;t the first time ever that I retreated to the last version when I had one and had to wait till one, two, or three point releases to come out. So I&#8217;m hesitant to say do it in production. Test it as much as possible. So I have a lot of things on my screen, but not the right thing. Here, so it is. Oh, Ryan, we are pretty good time wise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t have an additional&#8230; So, when we say how to get started, what was the first thing most difficult part for you for learning, or was there a mind shift until it clicked? Just to kind of get away from a fear of learning something new, and was there something when you go back ages on the theme.json thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Tammie Lister: </em></strong>So for me, it was realizing it wasn&#8217;t as hard as I maybe mentally thought it was. It was just the same with learning anything. You always think it&#8217;s going to be super hard, or at least with me, I read like dev doc and I&#8217;m like&#8230; My brain makes that noise. And then I just letting my theme be lighter. Letting it take the weight of that, giving up control, which as someone that&#8217;s maybe a bit of an old themer, giving up control of things, that&#8217;s an interesting process to go through. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really important embracing those foundations. And when you do, there&#8217;s that mind shift of creating in the editor. That was the moment that&#8230; And I&#8217;m still going through the process. I think it&#8217;s a process, and it&#8217;s a process as these tools are evolving. We&#8217;re talking about be gentle, they&#8217;re in production. These tools are still evolving and working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using these tools now before it&#8217;s released, then you&#8217;re going to hit bugs and report them. But that&#8217;s the thing. This theme.json also&#8230; the moment I kind of, the Jenga box, the blocks fell in my brain was I stopped seeing it as global stars. And I knew it wasn&#8217;t just global stars, but I felt it wasn&#8217;t just global stars and this felt like it could be the backbone of my theme, and it felt like it wasn&#8217;t everything in my theme, but it felt like it could be the backbone, is the best way I can describe it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I could hang my theme from it. And we&#8217;ve hung our theme from functions.php wrongly, I think. So it was just that change from PHP to doing it all in the editor and creating and seeing that JSON. It just was free, and it&#8217;s more in line with how things are made outside WordPress, which I think is delightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Any comments from you that you want to add, Daisy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So when I first started working with a theme.json file, I found that I had to&#8230; So there&#8217;s a whole section called styles, and I had to realign my thinking about what that meant, because what it&#8217;s saying is there are style settings in your blocks or for your site level depending on how it&#8217;s being applied, and what you&#8217;re doing is configuring the defaults for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I think of the theme.json file as a default file, then it helped me frame it so that I&#8217;m not necessarily replacing my CSS depending on&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m letting theme.json do the heavy lifting, kind of like Tammie said, but then I can take it further if I feel like I need to, or I want to. So I like thinking of it as a configuration file or a defaults file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a good point. Jeff, do you have any stories how I came about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: It&#8217;s been really helpful to pair on it with people, to work on a theme with someone. I think if my team at Automattic. It&#8217;s a very culture of collaboration, and if you have the opportunity to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having trouble with this. Would you want to work on this?&#8221; With someone like that, because this definitely can be a head bashing kind of why is this not being applied? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally just wrote color green. Why is it not green? It can be so frustrating dealing with that. So to have someone just to look at your code and be like &#8220;Oh, you missed a comma or actually you need an extra key there&#8221; is really, really helpful for something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah. So well, I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of our show. This has been very interesting and inspiring. So thank you all so much. And for those who want to dive into at a guided kind of testing session, Anne McCarthy, who, as you might know, runs the Full Site Editing Outreach program, she&#8217;s about to post the eighth call for testing, and it will all be about the theme.json file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as soon as it&#8217;s out, I will share a link in the show notes. And of course, also if you subscribed to our Gutenberg Times newsletter, you will definitely be informed about that. So at this point, I only have two more questions for our panelists. So do you have any announcements that you couldn&#8217;t get out before and you want the people to keep in mind? And if people want to get in touch with you, what would be the best way. Tammie, you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. So I&#8217;m comatose in all the things. I&#8217;m pretty easy to find in a good way. And I love chatting to people. So please do. I think my thing to say would be remember all of what happening now you can help shape. Just because we&#8217;ve sat here talking about it doesn&#8217;t mean we know anything more than you? It just means we&#8217;ve poked it and we&#8217;ve played around with the code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do that. Start exploring it. And it&#8217;s a lot more accessible than it ever was. It&#8217;s starting to be more accessible. There&#8217;s more documentation than there ever was coming out. And if you care about what happens with themes or you ever cared about what happens to themes, and maybe you could have that reignited, start to join the conversation. And I guess my final point would be, I think my hope is to see this experimentation come back to themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we forgot about that a little bit and we need to have some fun again in these. We used to have so much fun in WordPress themes, and I look forward to not just themes to have a purpose, but just themes that are art, themes that are just wacky experiments, and start enjoying theming and make some art. I&#8217;m really excited to see what things people create and use them just for one day even. That&#8217;d be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So Jeff, anything you want to have people keep in mind, and how to get in contact with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. Contact at J-F-F-N-G. And I guess keeping in mind, I&#8217;m just building on the last thing Tammie said, perhaps find a way to have fun with it and get curious about it, and try it. There&#8217;s really to me, a fundamental tendance of learning about something or you just have, how do I get curious about this thing? How do I play with it and have fun? And that&#8217;s going to be the most important thing to keep in at the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you, Jeff, and thank you so much for the audio work on the demo. Daisy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen on most things, Olsen with an E, and I would say that as far as what you can do as the next step if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about this, is go to&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure that Birgit has a link to this somewhere, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">theme experiments repository on GitHub</a> in the WordPress space has things that other people have done or are working on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I love to see examples of something in action to help me learn more about it and to see what other people have done. So I would say go check out something.json files in there and see what people have come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you so much. So big thank you to Daisy, Jeff, and Tammie to come today and make your time. A big thank you also for the viewers with all your great questions. I think we got a great array of it. And if you have more questions, you can always send them to me via email to <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, and I&#8217;ll get you the answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the recording of the show will be available in a few minutes on our YouTube channel. And I&#8217;ll share all the links then also in the video description. And within a few days, we will have also a transcript that we will publish on the Gutenbergtimes.com. So be well, good-bye, and good luck. That was fun. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: Thank you, everyone.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:23:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: Major Revamp Coming to GitHub Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:137:\"https://wptavern.com/major-revamp-coming-to-github-issues?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=major-revamp-coming-to-github-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2872:\"<p>This week GitHub unveiled new features that will be included in a total revamp of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://github.com/features/issues\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Issues</a>, including project tables that are similar to spreadsheets, custom fields, a keyboard driven command palette, improved task lists, and issue forms.

Tools that hard-code a specific methodology are too rigid and complex to flex to whatever the moment demands.

Instead of the user-centric call for testing features from the UI, program lead Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/06/24/call-for-testing-thrive-with-theme-json/\">asks that volunteers dive into code</a>. The new adventure is all about testing <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twist is likely to limit the pool of usual volunteers. However, it could open it up to an audience that may have been sitting on the sideline for the previous tests: theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before jumping headfirst <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/\">theme JSON files</a>, we should probably all get on the same page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been calling <code>theme.json</code> the tipping point between the old WordPress and the new WordPress. When version 5.0 of the core platform launched in late 2018, it was a revolutionary step forward, but not on the surface. A new editor is just a new editor. Some will love it; others will hate it.  And, it was more often clunky than not.  For the most part, WordPress was still WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core software was due for an upending. Newer technologies were not only democratizing publishing in their own ways, but they were also bringing that same concept to design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of blocks was merely foundational. The new editor was an imperfect tool, often feeling like the proverbial round peg being shoved into a square hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to live out the early vision of the Gutenberg project was to continue bridging the gap between what the user sees in the admin and what gets output on the front end. That is what the <code>theme.json</code> file is all about. It is a translator that allows users, themes, and WordPress to all speak the same language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What does this mean exactly?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a user&rsquo;s viewpoint, they see all sorts of controls for changing their blocks. Color, font size, alignment, and other options are tools that allow them to customize their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing a profile card for my cat using block options.\n\n\n\n<p>There are severe limitations with what is possible in the current system. Theme authors can register a handful of options. Outside of that, the theme and block systems can feel like they are pitted against each other for control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where the <code>theme.json</code> file comes in. It allows themes and WordPress to get on the same page, creating a standardized system that improves the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This file that lives a theme&rsquo;s root folder hands over the power to configure dozens of presets (e.g., color and font options), custom CSS properties, and default styles for blocks and HTML elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives themers the power to enable or disable specific features. For example, developers can turn off the ability for users to set a custom font size but provide access to their perfect scale of choices that fit into the design&rsquo;s vertical rhythm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it will move beyond the simple configuration of blocks in the content editor. When the global styles system launches alongside the site editor in the future, users will customize many of the presets and overwrite the default block styles. Because everyone is speaking that same language, fewer conflicts arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As designer Tammie Lister pointed out in her piece for Ephermeral Themes, <a href=\"https://ephemeralthemes.com/2021/06/20/theme-json-inspires/\">Theme.json inspires</a>, themes have been stuck. The software, the community, has put too much responsibility on the shoulders of themers over the years. They have had to innovate and build the systems that should have been coming from WordPress. Not only did the core platform need to be turned on its head, but the design system deserved an overhaul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am very aware that saying &lsquo;first major theme process to core&rsquo; in years is quite a statement,&rdquo; wrote Lister. &ldquo;Theme.json to me is that though. I don&rsquo;t say this ignoring iterations and improvements, WordPress is a project flowing with the energy of those. However, themes were on life support stuck in a land when the rest of front end development was moving on. It wasn&rsquo;t for some trying to change that, mostly when they did the time wasn&rsquo;t right and as it didn&rsquo;t come from core it was always a harder change.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is time for a new front-end design era. But, first, we must test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Testing Theme JSON</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Real-world theme.json file.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The more I journeyed into this call for testing, the more I realized it did not feel right for me. Over the past couple of months, I have already been in the thick of working from the <code>theme.json</code> file. I know most of the little quirks and see the gaps. The tricks for working with it feel second nature to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have performed all of the beginner and intermediate steps dozens upon dozens of times. I have already filed tickets for any issues I have run into. Or, someone else has already beat me to the punch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those stages of this testing round need fresh eyes. The best feedback will be from theme authors who will be viewing the problems through a different pair of lenses.  If you are in this group, there is no time like the present to test and provide feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advanced stage calls for recreating a classic theme using <code>theme.json</code>. It is best to stick with something simple. Otherwise, you could be looking at a weeks-long experiment. McCarthy recommends Twenty Twenty or Storefront. I have already been performing this song and dance too. My test project was an old theme that I gutted and turned into a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one overarching issue that I keep coming back to. It is that theme authors must work from a JSON file at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind using JSON. It is a universal format that we can pass around from JavaScript to PHP. Third-party APIs can understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am currently sitting on top of 900+ lines of code in my <code>theme.json</code>. I have heard from a couple of other theme authors who have been doing deep work with similar numbers. I expect it to only grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Number of lines&rdquo; is not necessarily some metric where a specific total is a dividing point between &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; The problem is that comments are not allowed in JSON files. One of the cornerstones of sound development is documenting code. Skipping out on documentation of a few dozen lines is not so bad. However, when you speed past 900, things can get out of hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, at a certain point, you start wanting to split pieces into their own groups. This much code is begging for better organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that is currently missing is a PHP layer for theme authors to use. Remember, JSON is a universal format. It is easy to convert PHP to JSON and vice-versa. Building in this layer for theme authors would accomplish two things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>They can organize what will likely be 1,000s of lines of code.</li><li>It will be easier to transition to the new system.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter point is likely the most salient. PHP has been the language of theming since the theming has been around. Developers know it and are comfortable using it, and WordPress should meet them in the middle. If we are closing gaps, this is the one that needs filling before more configuration possibilities are added and <code>theme.json</code> files balloon into unwieldy, 5,000-line behemoths.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 03:30:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.8 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/wordpress-5-8-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3891:\"<p>WordPress 5.8 Beta 4 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so it is not recommended to run this version on a production site.

You come across as more engaged, friendly and confident as eye contact can influence the person whom you speak to and it is a form of body language that serves to either open or close the doors to communication.\n\nResearch in Austin, Texas has proven that adults make eye contact 30% to 60% of the time during an average conversation but increases to 60 to 70% when they wish to deepen their emotional connection. Since eye contact is so important, how can we learn to increase or make more eye contact with people? In particular, children with Autism face more of such challenges. Thus, we will also look into how people with Autism – a condition associated with difficulties in social interactions – can seek help to enhance their social interaction skills, through some tips given below:\n\n<strong>1. Understand that it will take time</strong>\n\nTraining yourself to make eye contact with people that you engage conversation with will take time. The training involved breaking away from your old habits, introducing yourself with the new habits and of course, internalising the new habits.\n\n<strong>2. Start with the familiar </strong>\n\nSimply begin by adopting normal eye contact when speaking to people whom you are acquainted with. After a few tries, expand the group to include people whom you just gotten to know. In the beginning, maintain eye contact for about 30% of the time, thereafter, increasing the percentage gradually. Researchers suggest that maintaining eye contact 60% to 70% of the time is ideal for creating rapport and will not come across as aggressive. Given this general benchmark, tracking your progress is important with the objective in mind to reach an ideal eye contact time.\n\nOvertime, confidence grows and you would have acquired the skill of eye contact.\n\n<strong>3. Slowly work your way up</strong>\n\nIt can be tricky to make consistent eye contact with people when you are not use to it. It can be daunting and mentally draining as you try to increase your level of eye contact. Questions also arise as to how to make eye contact while not overdoing it, which leads to awkwardness of social situations.\n\nIt may be helpful to slowly work your way up to making a solid amount of eye contact till it becomes an automatic, effortless skill. Start practicing by using a mirror or a image of a pair of eyes. As a form of visual practice, you can also put a few pairs of eyes to simulate an engagement with multiple audiences in a conversation. This will train your eye muscles to be accustomed to looking at people in the eye.\n\n<strong>4. A point to note for Autism</strong>\n\nGenerally, as Autism is a spectrum and vary widely, therapist trained in Applied Behavior Therapy (ABA) may be engaged to help the child. Managing eye contact issues in autistic children might be challenging and can result in frustration to both parent and child.\n\nHowever, for children with mild social interaction issues and are unable to maintain eye contact, self-help training would still be possible. Its approach, being similar to the strategies discussed above, albeit, at a slower pace. Regular review of the skill attainment, coupled with the use of cues and reminders would be helpful. Saying verbal cues such as “eyes looking”, accompanied with visual cue with an action that comprises the use of your index and 3rd finger (pointing into the child’s eyes and moving it towards your eyes), can be used to effectively convey the need to maintain eye contact.\n\nIn conclusion, many would agree with the importance of eye contact in communication. How long you suppose to prolong your eye contact will depend very much on the culture, customs, gender, your relation with the person you are communicating with and your status as compared to theirs. In practice, one should try to make as much eye contact as possible and not beat yourself up over the times that you do not.\n\n<hr />\n\nCognitive specialises in supporting children with special needs &amp; difficulties in learning, and customizes unique strategies for English, Mathematics &amp; Science, to enhance their knowledge intake &amp; application.

Being bombarded by terms such as learning centre, tuition centre as well as literacy centres, it is unsurprising that we tend to see them as the same. This article will help us distinguish a learning centre from a tuition centre. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, what makes are learning centre different from a tuition centre is the different objectives that each of them set. Looking at the definitions will give us a clearer picture. A learning centre is defined as a self-contained section of a designated area in which students engage in independent and self-directed learning activities with the help of carefully planned activities and materials prepared to facilitate learning outcomes. Commonly, it is where students congregate in small groups to accomplish given learning tasks. Typically, students can work independently in these centres, sometimes while the teacher works with a small reading group. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, a tuition centre is a special term for private educational institutions. They are usually in abundance and is most popular in countries such as Indonesia, India, Singapore as well as in the Middle Eastern regions. Students are usually taught how to tackle examination questions. The main focus is on rote learning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From these definitions, we can see that the main difference is the objective that these centres want to achieve. The former promotes independent learning amongst students whereas the latter usually feed students with the relevant information straight away and students are then encourage to memorise whatever that is being taught. In other words, this is often termed as rote learning. Learning centres advocate the learning process of self-discovery, whereby teachers do not merely “spoon feed”. Instead, students are given tasks that help them learn and discover along the way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This leads us to the next point of the effectiveness of each of them. While both are effective in helping students improve their grades generally, it is good to note that learning centres, having to equip students with the skill of learning, will take a longer time, as compared to tuition centres, to show their effectiveness. This is because picking up a new skill involves time and consistent practice is needed for students to acquire a skill, which will translate to a longer time for its effectiveness to show. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conversely, enrolling into a tuition centre is a quick remedy to bad grades as students are just “spoon-fed” with the information that is needed in exams (according to the syllabus). This helps students to gain the relevant knowledge quickly so that they are able to perform better in their next exam. Clearly, this also shows the advantage of rote learning as grades can jump a lot within a short period of time as long as the student puts in his/her fair share of effort to absorb what the teacher has taught and put in into his memory. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having said all of that, another difference of a learning centre and tuition centre is also their specialty and the customers that they will eventually attract. In a society such as Singapore, who primarily focuses on rote learning, tuition centres are usually sought after by students who want to give a little boost to their already bad/excellent grades. So what is the relevance of a learning centre then? It is good to note that, despite Singaporean students being pushed and funnelled into rote learning, it does not suit everybody as there simply isn’t a one size fits all when it comes to learning. For one, children with learning difficulties fall through the cracks and are thus left out when they see their peers excelling. Therefore, these students need a special form of help for them to integrate into the MOE education system. Learning centres will, hence, be a better option for them. Overall, tuition centres focus in rote learning whereas learning centres commonly focus in other forms of effective learning to help a student learn better.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Consequently, the type of skill set that is required by the teacher will differ for the two respective centres due to the different type of service that the two centres fundamentally provide. For a learning centre, more specialised skills is required from the teacher as students are taught effective learning skills, instead of the content from the syllabus. Also, as learning centres are supposed to work with the needs of different learning methods that each student possess (thus, the need to equip them with the learning skill), a specialised degree may be required, depending on what the objectives of the learning centres are. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In contrast, tuition centres are more lax in their requirements of a teacher. Anybody who is able or have a passion for teaching can teach. This is especially for private tutoring, where NIE teachers are not necessarily required to teach as long as the student does not demand for a NIE teacher. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, the job scope of the teachers will also differ. Since learning centres are for self-discovery and self-directed learning, it implies that teachers do not need to stand in front of the classroom all the time to deliver a lesson. If the lesson lasts for two hours, teachers need not deliver for two hours. They only attend to the student when there is a need to (i.e. activities are to be held) or when the student needs it. On the other hand, as tuition centres are focused on teaching students the relevant knowledge, they are similar to conventional classroom teaching, whereby, teachers have to stand in front of the classroom and deliver the content knowledge. If the tuition lasts for two hours, tutors deliver the content for two hours. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, not to be ignored, some similarities exist between a learning and tuition centre. Despite their stark differences, both will eventually help students improve their grades. Finally, both centres serve as supplements to schools, which most students are supposed to attend in Singapore. </span></p>', 'Difference between a learning and tuition centre', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'difference-between-a-learning-and-tuition-centre', '', '', '2015-04-20 02:40:21', '2015-04-20 02:40:21', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=2535', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Behavior and attitude corrections are the 2 most common issues that parents spent the most time in.  This is so as parents recognized the importance of nurturing our children in a way that will allow them to comply with social norms, thereby, ensuring their survival in society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Parents often wonder why different outcomes are yielded even when all their children are brought up using the same parenting approach and environment.  Children, at different stages of their life, are influenced differently due to environmental factors.  School, teachers, friends, relatives and anyone that has been in contact with your child; events that your child has been through or child’s ability to manage stress may cause a change in behavior and attitude.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, focusing on correcting each behavior and attitude in your parenting approach can be exhausting and frustrating for the whole family.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #993300;\"> <i>“Values are essential components of belief systems. They are the highly-perceptible ingredients that help bind members of social groups and cultures together in their common belief systems. Values are action-oriented, providing fast, simplified judgement calls for certain kinds of situation. They reduce the need for time-consuming consideration of alternative views and actions, and are often applied where factual information is not available.”</i><a style=\"color: #993300;\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Isabelle/Desktop/parenting%20challenges%20krystal.docx#_ftn1\"><span class=\"s3\"><b><i>[1]</i></b></span></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A value system and belief focuses on developing the understanding of what is right and wrong in given contexts in life.  Hence, one should focus on building a strong foundation for your child by inculcating the correct basic value system and beliefs as it will make parenting efforts easier.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Learning from various life occurrences (that happens to the child) integrates the teachings from parents with what they experience in reality.  By reflecting upon these events that had occurred, it takes away the “blaming effect” on a child and shifts the focus on the incident.  It can take place virtually anywhere, involving directly or indirectly with the child.  For example, when coaching a child on ethical code: “One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself”, parents can take forever to explain this very principle to the young mind without a context in reality.  Therefore, parents might want to use real life situations to help their children understand. Referring back to the example earlier, a common occurrence could be an incident when you missed a train station due to inconsiderate passengers on board.  You can take the opportunity to use this incident as a learning moment by discussing your thoughts with your child and ask him how he feels about the whole event.  You may then bring in this quote to relate to the incident and advice your child that before he does anything to others, he should think about how he feels when the same thing is done to him.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Redefining Success and Failure</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being aware of what your child can and cannot do and moderating your expectations, would foster better parent-children relationships, as well as reduce stress levels in the family.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A child with Autism has difficulties in social interactions and connection to the outside world.  Children with Dyslexia have a hard time reading, writing and spelling words.  Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) will need to cope with their short attention span and impulsiveness when making decisions.  Recognizing and accepting your child’s natural difficulties will help you to cope with your expectations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moderating expectations will support you in redefining the measurement for success and failure based on your child’s needs.  For a child with Autism, sustaining eye contact while holding a conversation would constitute ultimate success.  However, it is through a series of goal setting and redefining of successes and failures is what propels the journey for ultimate success.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Time – Your friend or Your Enemy</b></span><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Often we hear of sayings about how precious time is. Familiar sayings such as “Money can’t buy you time”, “Time wait for no man”, “Take care of the minutes for the hours will take care of themselves” remind us that time is priceless.  However, productivity and the effective use of time is another matter altogether.  Have we ever had an experience where we try to complete a task in a rush, only to end up spending more time clearing the mess created by the rush job thereafter?  One should therefore conclude that effective time management does not necessarily mean rushing to complete whatever we were set up to do, particularly for nurturing our child\'s academic aspect. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Delaying or deferring for a year or so in school may not necessarily be a bad idea for your child as it allows your child to have more time to cope with his work and environment.  For parents, it might also give you a breather.  After all, Singapore is an education hub with lots of opportunities for all children to excel.  Even though it is also a fast paced society, more haste does lead to less speed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, delay in seeking professional help when your child does not meet his developmental goals is not recommended.  It is through the predetermined benchmarks that determine your child’s growth, especially during his growing years, where missed opportunities in learning - even for short periods - that can be costly to his future development.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Building Bond</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\">“<span style=\"color: #993300;\">The greatest gift you can give another is the purity of your attention.” – Richard Moss</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You will be surprised that what our child truly needed and wanted from us is just a listening ear.  Your child needs friends and someone that they feel safe to share their inner feelings with.  As much as parents face challenges, the child’s environment is equally challenging for him.  However, the key difference lies in the fact that, as adults, we possess the maturity to be able to better manage our time, stress and thoughts whereas the child has not reached this very phase yet.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once in a while, it is good to just let go of our troubles and simply spend time sitting down together as a family. Setting aside family time will provide our children with the emotional comfort they need.  Over time, you will experience positive benefits and reap good results by seeing your child opening up their thoughts and opinions to you, listening to you and respecting your opinions when it comes to their decision making. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Managing Guilt</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is common to see that parents felt guilty that their child has learning difficulties, especially during the early stages. Before the child was diagnosed, they vent their anger at him for not concentrating, being lazy and naughty.  Once parent understand the situation, they will then try to make up to him by excusing him from performing perceived difficult task.  Blaming the environment and others when their child cannot cope are quite common.  Eventually, the result would be that the child’s ability deteriorates and he is unable to keep up with his peers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being unrelenting can sometimes be an act of good deed to our child.  Take into account of our child’s long-term well-being and ensuring that they are constantly exposed to challenges and problem solving issues on their own trains their independence.  Remind yourself that you will not be there forever to help your child and you will need to let go in order to allow your child to survive without the need for your presence.  Tell yourself that it is not fair for his other siblings to take on the role of the caregiver, if you were to leave this world one day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We have seen successes in Cognitive Development Learning Centre when parents learn to allow their child to explore their new frontier and strengths.  Such children are able to show their parents that they are able to do what is beyond common expectations of learning difficulties.  We have children who can cook very well, play badminton competitively and excel in art.  These skills would not have been acquired had the parents been too protective of their child.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In conclusion, a one-size-fits-all guide in parenting does not exist.  Mistakes often happen, frustrations still exist, emotions get out of control and parenting solutions are hard to come by.  Nonetheless, one thing is for sure: we strive to do our best for our children while learning to be a good parent and this intention itself, is all it takes.  Happy Parenting!</span></p>', 'Parenting – Towards Giving the Best to our Child', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'parenting', '', '', '2015-05-15 02:43:56', '2015-05-15 02:43:56', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=2537', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Here are some interesting questions posted to Cognitive Development Learning Centre:\n\n<strong>1. Why do you think fathers’ involvement in school is good for the child with special needs?</strong>\n\nA child with special needs is just like any other ordinary child. The only issue they face is a higher level of difficulties in coping with society / studies as compared to their peers, but that does not mean that they are unaware of their surrounding / environment.\n\nAll children will look up to their parents - mother and father - for guidance and thus the father figure is as important as the mother. Fundamentally, couples need to agree with how their family culture would be like, how they would like to bring up their children, what kind of value system they would like to inculcate and agree on the roles and responsibilities that each of them will assume.\n\nThe conduct of the parents has great influence on the child and thus it is more important that both parties collaborate to bring up their children.\n\n<strong>2. Apart from Parent support groups, how does your school reach out to parents to increase their involvement?</strong>\n\nIn Cognitive Development, we see our parents on a periodic basis to review, discuss and to agree on specific strategies to help their child to progress academically.\n\nDuring our review sessions, other than academic discussion, we also engage parents in other parenting matters and offer simple tips and tools on behaviorial management and educational support at home.  Such solutions would usually reinforce the child’s learning, thereby providing a holistic support for the child.\n\n<strong>3. Do mothers or fathers make up a greater proportion of the Parent support group? (please give an estimate of the percentages by gender, if possible)</strong>\n\nAsian culture is such that parents tend to keep parenting of special-needs children private.\n\nOur parental support group tends to gear towards talks by experts rather than a forum for discussion.  However, we realized that parents usually want a more practical approach towards parenting special-needs children.\n\nMothers make up of about 65% who attended the meeting.  Of the 35% of father attending the meeting, only about 10% would contribute their ideas or ask questions.\n\nTo supplement the parent support group, we also have periodic 1 to 1 meetings with parents and we encourage both parents to meet us.\n\nBased on this experience, we have the intention to realign our parent support group by creating smaller groups of parents to facilitate active discussion and sharing, with the objective of supporting our parents better.\n\n<strong>4. What are some of the challenges you face in getting fathers to be more involved in their child’s programme?</strong>\n\n<strong>5. What are some effective ways of targeting fathers more and addressing the barriers to their involvement?</strong>\n\n(Ans for 4 &amp; 5)  As a private organization, we can only encourage both fathers and mothers to be involved in their child’s programme.\n\nThe encouragement includes small talks with parents to understand individual-specific parenting challenges.  We also create opportunities for both father and mother to be involved in helping their child through demonstrating a few simple behavioral management techniques on their child to show that they can also do it.  We notice that by showing simple techniques, parents tend to attempt to try and be involved.\n\n<strong>6. What are some of the most common issues that arise in your feedback and discussion sessions with parents, particularly fathers?</strong>\n\nParenting a special-needs child tend to take up more time than usual.  One of the common and important issues we observed is that couples are not spending enough time together.\n\nIn Cognitive Development, we encourage parents to take breaks from their children, which can be as short as an 1 hour.  Without the presence of their child, it allow couples to bond, talk and just simply, be together.\n\nParents are the pillars of the family and are fundamentally an effective support of a special-needs child.  Such temporary retreat provides couples an opportunity to re-energize.\n\n<strong>7. Do you feel that fathers encounter different stresses from mothers with regard to managing a child with special needs? If so, what are some of the key stresses that fathers face?</strong>\n\nSupporting a special child can be costly to the family, both financially and emotionally.\n\nFinancial challenge can be the costs of specialists help, lost of income resulting from mothers having to stay at home to look after the child and multiple tuition to cope with schoolwork.\n\nEmotionally, it can be tiring and frustrating for parents to manage the child due to lack of training.  Other emotional challenge can also include the feeling of helplessness, guilt and embarrassment.\n\n<strong>8. Do most fathers seem to have a very clear understanding of their child\'s diagnosis?</strong>\n\nYes, most of them have a clear understanding of their child’s challenges.\n\n<strong>9. What do you feel are fathers’ general attitudes toward their special-needs child? Do you see many fathers who are committed to their special-needs children and are able to devote long hours to their physical and emotional care?</strong>\n\nThere is an increasing trend that fathers are more committed. However, most commitment is more on a macro basis rather than the daily affairs of the child.\n\nIt is not necessary to devote long hours with the child. Basically it all comes down to quality bonding activities like playing with the child, doing outdoor sports, board game or simply siting down for a chit-chat session with the child for 30 minutes. However, as a father, they would still need to manage their psychological barrier, especially in the areas of emotional challenge first.\n\nA special-needs child possesses strengths as well, even though it might not be in their academics. In Cognitive Development, we have students who are very good in sailing, badminton, bowling and art. With some assistance, our children may start to do well in school. Accepting your child as special, being proud of what they are and treasuring every moment you spend with your child and family could bring the family closer and alleviate the emotional challenge of parents.\n\nIn addition, let’s not forget about the role of husbands as a provider of strength and morale support to his wife. All of us would agree that the foundation of a family rest on both couple, and not on merely on a party.\n\nIn families whereby the mother is managing the daily affairs of the child, it is good for the father to come in and provide his support whenever the mother faces difficulties in helping their child. This would not only built family bonding but also ensures that the wife take comfort, knowing that she has a caring and supportive husband to back her up.', 'The Family: A Pillar of Strength', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-family-a-pillar-of-strength', '', '', '2015-04-11 02:47:29', '2015-04-11 02:47:29', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=2539', 0, 'post', '', 3),

Multitasking is not advisable especially for children because it has a negative effect in their learning abilities.\n\nWith the rise of digital era, children are grown to do several things at a time. Watching TV or playing games while doing their homework is one example. Others may consider it as a norm but apparently, it is not good for our children.\n\nMultitasking affects the children’s learning abilities in different ways:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Higher tendency to be a slow learner</strong> – because their brain processes several things at a time, they might have a higher chance of difficulty in grasping and processing future information given to them.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Poor memory retention and recall process</strong> – children might have difficulty in recalling things in the past because of their divided attention while learning.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Lower chance of getting things done</strong> – while others may think that multitasking helps people get things done faster, experts say that it slows that productivity of a person. They become easily distracted because of the switching focus of the brain.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Mental exhaustion</strong> - juggling from one activity to another can stress the brain.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Low quality learning</strong> – because of divided attention while trying to learn something, there is a tendency to take information rapidly without putting much effort to study if it’s relevant or not.</li>\n</ul>\nResearches also show how multi-tasking affects learning negatively. In an article published in UCLA Newsroom, Stuart Wolpert quoted Russell Poldrack on several statements. Russell Poldrack, an Associate Professor of Psychology who conducted a research about multi-tasking said <em>“Multitasking adversely affects how you learn”</em> (Poldrack 2006). Poldrack also states that people don’t learn as much when multitasking compared to when you are paying full attention. Distractions while learning affects the ability of the brain to absorb information and results to poor memory in the long run. Researchers also agree that this is one of the factors why children do not perform well in school.\n\nIt’s not arguable that multitasking can be considered as a skill or talent and is very helpful. However, there is also no harm in considering precautions about its negative effects especially if it concerns the learning abilities of our children. Considering that divided attention is a possible cause of children’s lower performance in school, it is very important for parents to practice several ways to avoid it.\n\nFor children with ADHD, we encourage them to work in a clean space or table without anything but the stuff they need for their homework or project. Limiting the objects they see in their surroundings can help them focus on a single thing. Sticking up to a time schedule is also advisable. Let the children do one thing at a given schedule. It helps them focus and at the same time practice their time management. It also increases their productivity because they are less distracted and so they can finish a task quickly.\n\nThere are other more ways to avoid multitasking and help children to increase their performance.  However, the most important thing is the parents’ support and understanding of their children. You should know what your children needs. There are a lot of ways to guide you but there is no guarantee that one style could work for all. Only you can identify what’s best for your children.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReference:\n\nWolpert, Stuart. 2006. \"Don’t Talk to a Friend While Reading This; MultiTasking Adversely Affects the Brain’s Learning Systems, UCLA Scientists Report.\" <em>UCLA Newsroom.</em> July 25.

But if you think education is all they need, maybe you should think twice.\n\nA lot of opportunities for learning have been developed for children of different ages nowadays.  Aside from sending their children to regular academic schools, parents now also have the liberty to enroll their children in special classes where they can learn about music, arts, sports etc. Some parents believe that it’s best to keep their children busy about school stuff and learning. However, let us not forget that the first and the best place to learn is at home.  Sure, you learn a lot of things in school, but there are important lessons and skills you will need in life that one can only learn at home.\n\nTeaching the children to do household chores is very beneficial in their growth. Most families nowadays hire housemaids to do the chores, so children don’t get to experience doing it anymore. But researches argue that it’s still necessary to let children do them. Here’s why:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Giving tasks to your children helps them develop their sense of responsibility. It helps them realize their accountability as part of the family. An article published in <em>centerforparentingeducation.org</em>  also states that <em>“Holding them accountable for their chores can increase a sense of themselves as responsible and actually <strong>make them more responsible</strong>. Children will feel more capable for having met their obligations and completed their tasks.”(Responsibility and Chores n.d.)  </em>This can also make them more independent.</li>\n 	<li>Doing chores can also expose your children into the idea of “teamwork”. Helping at home can develop their sense of participation and potential to be a team player in the future whether in school or in work.</li>\n 	<li>Being able to do household chores also increases your children’s self- esteem. Knowing that there are other things they can do aside from what they learn in school makes them feel good about themselves. <em>“By completing household tasks, they may not always be the star student or athlete, but they will know that they can contribute to the family, begin to take care of themselves, and learn skills that they will need as an adult.” (Responsibility and Chores n.d.)</em></li>\n 	<li>Moving around and doing tasks at home can also enhance your children’s motor skills, both gross and fine motor skills. It can also be their form of exercise.</li>\n 	<li>Letting your children complete their tasks at a given time span can also improve their time management skills. <em>“Chores can help older kids and teens build good habits early”(Responsibility and Chores n.d.) </em>They learn to manage their time and priorities.</li>\n 	<li>Household chores can also be another activity for your children. It takes away the mundane activities of studying. It’s good to have them a little break from all the school works.</li>\n 	<li>Lastly, having your children help in doing the chores provides a special way of bonding and spending time with them. Some children find it easier to open up with their parents when their doing task together.</li>\n</ul>\nHelping at home can be a training ground for your children to whatever responsibilities they may have in the future. By doing so, they can learn skills that might be of their advantage when they grow up. <em>“Performing chores offers kids a feeling of self-sufficiency, helps them develop a work ethic, is tied to academic success in school, makes them feel useful and teaches them the importance of helping others and contributing to the greater good.” (Bently 2015)</em>\n\nAlthough, most parents can also argue that it is not easy to insist chores to their children.  It is a nature for the children to refuse to do chores when they are told to. Maybe because the idea of household chores has always been related as a burden. But there are ways that can turn household chores into a more likely activity for the children.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Start them young</strong>. This doesn’t mean that you let your children do huge tasks at an early age. You should still be considerate in delegating tasks to your children based on their age. You can start by practicing them to keep their toys every after they’re done playing. You can gradually increase the level of tasks as they grow old but never ever push them too hard.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Reward system. </strong>Appreciate every little accomplishment. Compliment them or give them something. Children love rewards and it drives them to do better.</li>\n</ul>\nMost importantly, instill in their minds that asking them to help-out is not a punishment nor an obligation. Explain to them that it is for their benefit and everything they learn from it is for their advantage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nBently, Amy. 2015. \"Giving kids household chores leads to positive life lessons.\" <em>The Orange County register.</em> December 8.

Generally, effective learning takes place when we learn subjects that we are interested in and often struggle in areas that we have no interest.\n\nUnlike individuals with learning difficulties, they are often confronted by a mismatch in their learning style, lack of interest, attitude towards the subject matter or simply do not wish to learn. In contrast, individuals with learning difficulties faces significant difficulties in skills required for the individual to learn, such as speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or lack of sustain attention span. Therefore, coaching approach for individuals with difficulties in learning would most certainly be focused on behavioral and learning styles.\n\nSome suggestions as follows:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Memory improvement basics. How a child thinks and the way they sense and perceive their surroundings often affects the way they learn. The connections to memory are also associated with our senses and perceptions creating a complex and often individualized process of learning and memory.</li>\n 	<li>Keep learning and practicing new things. Interest plays a critical role in learning. When a student is interested in the topics or subjects they naturally learn and retain information at a higher rate. Helping your child develop a variety of interests will naturally increase their level of learning overall.</li>\n 	<li>Learn in multiple ways. Research has shown that effective learning takes place when students receive and process information in a variety of ways.</li>\n 	<li>Teach what you’ve learned to another person. Social interactions look at likely attitudes, habits, and strategies learners might take toward their work and how they engage with others when they learn. Learners can be independent, dependent, collaborative, competitive, participant or avoidant.</li>\n 	<li>Utilize previous learning to promote new learning. According to Soviet psychologist and social constructivist Lev Vygotsky (1896 – 1934) who developed the concept “Zone of Proximal Development” (ZPD), when a student is in the ZPD for a particular task, providing the appropriate assistance will give the student enough of a “boost” to achieve the task. This concept and the concept of scaffolding is widely used to promote new learning.</li>\n 	<li>Gain practical experience. It’s much easier for children to remember what they learn when they get to experience it personally.</li>\n 	<li>Look up answers rather than struggle to remember. Don’t push them too hard when they can’t remember something, it can cause stress to the brain. It doesn’t hurt to look it up and refresh your memory.</li>\n 	<li>Understand how you learn best. You may want to start with understanding your individual patterns of learning and how those mentioned above affect how you learn.</li>\n 	<li>Use testing to boost learning. Testing promote experiences and experiences makes it easier to remember.</li>\n 	<li>Stop multi-tasking. Undivided attention is not good when trying to learn something. Please refer to our detailed write-up for multi-tasking.</li>\n 	<li>Personality patterns focus on attention, emotion, and values. Understanding these differences allows you to predict the way your child might react and feel about different situations. From your perspective you can then try to understand the patterns of your child. The differences between you and your child or student are not necessarily wrong or right and you will most likely find their patterns are different, sometimes very different than your own. It’s important, however, to capitalize on what works for your child and to help them to utilize those patterns and learning styles toward a greater capacity to learn and remember.</li>\n</ul>\nKnowing how your child learns is one way to help them succeed. You should try to:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Teach the most difficult lessons using your child’s preferred learning style.</li>\n 	<li>Reinforce lessons using multiple learning styles.</li>\n 	<li>Help your child improve learning skills in the learning styles he or she is less comfortable with.</li>\n</ul>\nIn some cases, this requires helping your children understand their own abilities. This may include teaching some compensation and coping techniques.\n\nBut aside from adjusting and finding the right learning style for children with difficulties, it is also important to consider how do we help them emotionally. In times of difficulties, children also suffer emotionally and below are ways on how we could guide and provide them support:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Highlight their strengths, not their weaknesses. Though, you must focus in their weak areas in terms of learning, it is also significant to recognize their strengths to boost their confidence and drive to learn more.</li>\n 	<li>Let them play. Not only it can improve their social skills, it also prevents them from burning out.</li>\n 	<li>Manage your expectations and set achievable goals for your children.</li>\n 	<li>Avoid the labels. The mention of words such as “dumb” and “stupid” is no way helpful and only lowers their self-esteem.</li>\n 	<li>Have an open communication with them. Talk to them about their feelings and their struggles. Encourage them to open-up.</li>\n 	<li>Teach them the art of failing. Tell them that it’s okay to fail. They shouldn’t be afraid of failure and always try.</li>\n 	<li>Never compare. Avoid comparing them to other children because It will make them feel bad about themselves.</li>\n</ul>\nKey in helping your child is patience, understanding, cultivating interest and building trust to help him/her succeed.  Find out what is suitable for them because not everything the book says might work for them.

Hearsays here and there made it more complicated. People have different views about it because some information that are given to them or they believe in may not be true.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>People with learning difficulties lack intelligence.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nLearning difficulty has always been perceived as lack of intelligence and low IQ, but it shouldn’t. People with learning disabilities are not in any way less intelligent than other people. Like normal people, they also acquire the same potential to learn and excel. It’s just that their brain process information differently. <em>“…the issue is that their brains retrieve, interpret, organize, and distribute information in unique ways.”</em> (Rivas 2018). In short, their brain is just wired differently.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Learning difficulties can be outgrown.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAnother misconception about learning difficulty is that it disappears through time as the person matures. Learning difficulty can not actually be cured. It will always be part of the person as he/she grows old. People with learning difficulties can’t get away with it but they can cope with it or learn to overcome their difficulties. This is where the importance of guiding and training them while they are younger plays its part. With the proper guidance, they will eventually learn to manage and handle their disabilities in unique ways that is comfortable for them.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Learning difficulties can be easily identified.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThere is no medical procedure that can easily diagnose learning difficulty. It takes time to know whether a person has learning difficulty. It’s not as simple as taking X-ray or CT Scan. Professionals will have to check patterns of behavior and family history. Sometimes learning difficulty can go unnoticeable until the parents or teachers observe constant failure in the children’s academic development and send their child for psychological assessment. Therefore, it is always important to seek professional help to identify if your child has any learning issues.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>People with learning difficulties do not put much effort in learning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nConventional teaching methods may not work on people with learning difficulties. Their route between “here and there” can be full of curves, given that their understanding of the world may be different from us. In fact, they are the ones who exert/need to exert much effort in learning because they are different. That means it is double effort for them when it comes to learning. As such, people with learning difficulty are not lazy.\n\nThese misconceptions often lead to undesirable effects especially to people with difficulties, both mentally and emotionally. They may be discouraged to do better because they feel judged despite their efforts and struggles. That’s why it is very important for us to be educated about the nature of their situation. More often than not, our behavior towards their situation greatly affects them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReference:\n\nRivas, Katheryn. 2018. <em>verywell family.</em> September 11.

(3125, 1, '2018-11-08 03:58:09', '2018-11-08 03:58:09', 'Attention issues in children with learning <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/adhd-2/\">difficulties</a> are quite common. It is a major indication of ADHD <em>(Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</em>. People with ADHD tend to have short attention span. They have difficulty in focusing and tend to be more hyperactive. They are unable to stay still and their focus jumps from one to another, causing a constant shift in their attention. Attention issues also rises from learning disabilities such as dyslexia and autism. People with dyslexia and autism have a different method of processing information when learning. Their condition requires them to be more focused in order to process information effectively. Their brain works more than other people do in this instance, as such, having these learning difficulties often drains the brain and causes them to lose their attention easily.\n\n<strong>How to sustain attention of children with learning difficulties when learning?</strong>\n\nAttention issues are always a challenge for children when it comes to learning, especially with those who have learning difficulties. However, there are ways to help them overcome these issues.\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Declutter the classroom or workspace</strong></li>\n</ol>\nSetting a conducive place for learning is very important. For children with ADHD, it is best to keep the area clean and free from any distractions. Create a room solely for learning where electronic devices such as computers, iPads and television are removed. Keep them away from distractive noises such as sounds from the television or computer games and make sure the area is also well-ventilated. Remove any unnecessary items and only keep those you need for the lesson.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong>Divide lessons or tasks into short segments</strong></li>\n</ol>\nLong lessons are boring. It is recommended that you break it into short segments instead. Knowing the fact that the learning session is likely to be completed in a shorter time, there is higher chance for the children to be able to focus better during lesson. <em>“For a child with ADHD, the general rule of thumb is that a task is most likely to get done when the child knows that “the end is in sight” at the beginning of the task.”</em> (Additude Editors, 2011)\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong>Set a time frame for each task</strong></li>\n</ol>\nYou can try to set a timer for every task that you assign them to. This will help them be more conscious of how they should use their time properly. It challenges them to focus and finish the task within the given time frame. However, be considerate and realistic when setting time frame and constantly evaluate whether the time given is within the child’s capabilities.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong>Give them a break</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAfter the completion of a given task, give the children a few minutes to rest their mind. Do not jump from one task to another because it will bore and tire them. As mentioned above, they have a different way of processing information in their brain. That alone is exhausting. Pushing them too hard will exhaust their brain, causing them to lose attention even faster. Give them some time in between tasks to refresh their minds.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong>Use visuals when teaching</strong></li>\n</ol>\nMost children learn better through visual aid. They are likely to be more attentive when they see interesting illustrations. Children with autism has difficulty to stay engaged in tasks that they are not interested in but they pay attention to things they love. If something colourful or interesting catches their attention, they are likely to be more focused on it. Therefore, it will be more effective to use creative visuals and props when teaching. It boosts their interest in the lesson and it will also increase their hands-on participation in learning the concept taught.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li><strong>Do physical activities</strong></li>\n</ol>\nIncorporate physical activities when teaching children with learning difficulties. You can do simple exercises before class to warm them up. These exercises can include singing songs, dancing and doing simple workout routines. This would prepare them for the lesson and help them to be more attentive. <em>“Starting with 15 minutes of active play before a challenging task can also help a child stay more engaged.”</em> (Reeves, 2015)\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li><strong>Reward them</strong></li>\n</ol>\nPositive reinforcement is effective in increasing your children’s attention span. It is good to give them rewards whenever they finish a task. For example, they can watch TV or play once they finish their work. This method motivates them to complete their work, and it also creates a routine whereby they start to understand the concept completing their tasks first before engaging in other activities. <em>“Giving your child something to look forward to will energize him.”</em> (Additude Editors, 2011)\n<ol start=\"8\">\n 	<li><strong>Be with them</strong></li>\n</ol>\nFinally, be with them. For children with learning difficulties, they feel more motivated when they do their homework and study with the presence of another individual around. <em>“</em><em>Children can sustain attention longer when someone is physically with them.”</em> (Additude Editors, 2011). Helping them with their homework and studies can also enable you to monitor their progress and bond with the child at the same time.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>References</h1>\nAdditude Editors.

Dyslexia is the most common type of learning difficulty. People with dyslexia are characterized by their inability to read and write properly. <em>“</em><em>Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed.”</em> (Rose, 2009). People with dyslexia face difficulty in recognizing and connecting the particular phonetic sound of an alphabet to its respective alphabet. This causes them to have poor reading skills as they tend to mix up letters and numbers. Words and phrases may also appear merged or in reverse, and spaces are even lost.  It is also harder for them to spell and memorize words even if they have seen it for several times.\n\nAs dyslexia cannot be easily diagnosed, it is often misdiagnosed as other forms of learning difficulties. Because of their frustration of not being able to read properly no matter how hard they try, people with dyslexia often act up and portray rebellious behaviours that are commonly mistaken as laziness or lack of intelligence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dyslexia.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3143 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dyslexia-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"dyslexia\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brain.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3144 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brain-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"brain\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a>\n\nFor a typical reader, 3 parts of the brain are activated when they are reading:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Broca’s area\n<ul>\n 	<li>Broca’s area, located at the front of the brain, is responsible for whole word processing (understanding a whole word)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n 	<li>Parieto-temporal area\n<ul>\n 	<li>Left parieto-temporal area, located above the back ear, is responsible in decoding or breaking down a word (e.g. C+AT= CAT)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n 	<li>Occipital-temporal area\n<ul>\n 	<li>Occipito-temporal area, located behind the ears towards the back part of the head, functions as the visual word-form area (in the right side of the brain – it helps in word-form memory whereas the left side of the brain of this area is responsible for mapping phonetic sounds to the corresponding letters)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWhereas for a person with dyslexia, only one part of the brain is activated which is the broca’s area. This is because they are using their memory to read and say out words without having a proper understanding of how the sound is produced and the meaning of the word. This explains why some children with dyslexia are able to express themselves fluently but yet, are unable to read and write at an age-appropriate level.\n\nHowever, with appropriate intervention given, the part of the brain that was inactive would be activated. With phonics training, the child would be able to relate better to sound productions and structure of words.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>What are the symptoms of dyslexia?</strong>\n\nSymptoms of dyslexia varies from person to person. But most apparent symptoms are the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Difficulty in reading and mixing up letters in words and phrases</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in recognizing and giving out directions (confusion of left and right)</li>\n 	<li>Poor memory</li>\n 	<li>Poor handwriting</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in spelling out words</li>\n 	<li>Struggles in pronouncing long words</li>\n</ul>\nSymptoms of dyslexia are more easily observed in children as it is the age where most of the learning takes place and it is easier to observe any discrepancies in their learning habits. However, that does not mean that you cannot be diagnosed with dyslexia when you are already an adult. You can be diagnosed with dyslexia at any age.\n\nIf you observe any of these symptoms that is suspiciously a sign of dyslexia in your child, it is best to consult professionals and have your child undergo a psychological assessment.\n\n<strong>How to help people with dyslexia?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Let them be aware of their condition. It allows them to realize how they are different from other children and also helps them to handle it better.</li>\n 	<li>As parents and teachers, it is important to be their source of strength. They may have emotional breakdowns from time to time because of their struggles and frustrations in reading and writing.</li>\n 	<li>Dyslexia is not curable, but it is treatable with therapy. Have them undergo therapy which focuses on reading and writing. This way, professionals can help them develop strategies on how to manage their difficulty better.</li>\n 	<li>Provide assistive technology that is suitable for their condition, e.g. having a computer read out the words on the website as they read in order to help them cope better in reading.</li>\n 	<li>Show them examples of role models for them to look up to, i.e. people who have the same condition as them but are successful in life. This will enable them to realize that their condition is not a hindrance to their future, and that with hard work, they are able to excel in life.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>References</h1>\nRose, S. J.

(3168, 1, '2018-11-29 03:38:48', '2018-11-29 03:38:48', 'ADHD is one of the most common difficulty diagnosed in children. ADHD or <em>Attention- Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</em> is a behavioral syndrome caused by abnormalities in the development of the brain. The most observed characteristics of people with ADHD are being hyperactive, having difficulty in focusing and short attention span.\n\nAlthough it is generally considered as a behavioral disorder, the idea of <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/adhd-2/learning-difficulties/\">ADHD</a> still varies in different cultures. In America, 9% of school-aged children are diagnosed with ADHD. On the other hand, 0.5% of the school-aged children in France are diagnosed with ADHD. Aside from the large difference in numbers, the two countries also have different perspectives in the idea of ADHD.\n\n<strong>Approach</strong>\n\nAmericans view ADHD as a biological condition that can be treated through medication. Though ADHD is not curable, they believe that taking medications can lessen its symptoms. People in France on the other hand perceives ADHD as a psycho-social condition. “Instead of treating children\'s focusing and behavioral problems with drugs, French doctors prefer to look for the underlying issue that is causing the child distress—not in the child\'s brain but in the child\'s social context”. (Wedge 2018) While Americans view ADHD as a biological dysfunction and/or chemical imbalance in the brain’s development, French believes that it is more of a behavioral condition caused by psychological factors.\n\n<strong>Parenting</strong>\n\nAs the two cultures have a completely different views regarding ADHD, their parenting style and way of treatment is also different. Because Americans believe that the condition is biological, they are mostly dependent on stimulants. Unlike the French, they do not necessarily consider aspects such as lifestyle, diet and parenting as contributing factor.\n\nParents and Doctors in France are very strict in following a certain lifestyle in handling ADHD in children. Most Americans may not consider it but for the French, diet is one factor. They prefer a healthy diet for their children and refrain them from eating sweets and processed food.  “Clinicians who work with troubled children in this country—not to mention parents of many ADHD kids—are well aware that dietary interventions can sometimes help a child\'s problem.” (Wedge 2018)  They believe eating food with preservatives and artificial additives can worsen the children’s condition.\n\nThe parenting style of both cultures is also different. Parents in France are tighter in raising their kids than the Americans. According to Marilyn Wedge in <em>Why French Kids Don’t Have ADHD</em>, French parents provide <em>‘cadre’</em> in raising their children. The word <em>‘cadre’ </em>means a structure or frame. These are disciplinary frameworks they set in raising their children.  For example, children in France are taught to follow a certain time frame in their day-to-day activity strictly. They can’t do anything they wish to if it’s not yet time for that certain activity. Small things such as grabbing snacks from the fridge, playing or watching TV when they want to are strictly prohibited – everything is in time.  “Consistently enforced limits, in the French view, make children feel safe and secure.” (Wedge 2018)  French parents also believe that spanking the children as disciplinary action is not a form of child abuse. “The children grow up in families in which the rules are well-understood, and a clear family hierarchy is firmly in place.” (Wedge 2018)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nParents in America on the other hand are more liberated in raising their kids. They don’t necessarily provide a <em>‘cadre’</em> as the French. They have their own disciplinary measures and strategies in raising their kids. Of course, they still implement rules for the children, but they are not as strict as the French - and they are not in full control. Children in America are more open to speak out and say ‘no’ to their parents. They do some things in their own – grabbing snack or playing outdoors - without asking permission to their parents.\n\nIn comparison, we can say that French children are more behaved than the Americans. We can’t decide though whether which approach is correct about ADHD because giving medication also works for other culture. We may not be sure whether it’s the main reason why they have the least case of ADHD, but it’s safe to say that the French’s parenting style influences their numbers. And this is something that other culture should learn and adapt from them. While ADHD is a condition that cannot be cured, our approach towards it can lessen the symptoms and makes it more manageable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>References</h1>\nJackson, Eva. n.d. <em>Children In France don\'t Have ADHD-Here\'s Why.</em> Accessed November 27, 2018. https://thepowerofsilence.co/children-in-france-dont-have-adhd-heres-why/.\n\nWedge, Marilyn. 2018. <em>Why French Kids Don\'t Have ADHD.</em> March 8.

This disability originates before the age of 18. <em>(Disabilities, Definition of intellectual disability, 2013)</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Intellectual functioning</em> refers an individual’s general mental capacity, such as learning, reasoning, and problem solving. One way to measure intellectual functioning is through an IQ test. Generally, an IQ test score of around 70-75 indicates a limitation in intellectual functioning.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Adaptive behavior</em> refers to the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that are learnt and performed by people in their everyday lives. Limitations in adaptive behavior involves impairment of general mental abilities in three skills, namely:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li>Conceptual skills – language and literacy; money, time, and number concepts</li>\n 	<li>Social skills – empathy, social judgement, interpersonal communication skills, and the ability to make and retain friendships</li>\n 	<li>Practical skills – personal care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, and task management</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Causes of Intellectual Disability</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nThere are several factors that could cause Intellectual Disability.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Infections (both pre- and post-natal)</li>\n 	<li>Chromosomal abnormalities (Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome)</li>\n 	<li>Environmental (alcohol, drugs, or other toxins)</li>\n 	<li>Nutritional (malnutrition)</li>\n 	<li>Trauma (both pre- and post-natal)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Treatment for Intellectual Disability</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nIntellectual Disability is a life-long condition. However, with early, sustained and appropriate personalized support, it is possible to improve the individual’s level of life functioning. <em>(Disabilities, Definition of intellectual disability, 2013)</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe treatment for ID should focus on minimizing the potential debilitating effects of ID on the individual and their families, as well as to strengthen and expand on the individual’s strengths.\n\nMany types of supports and services can help, such as;\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Early <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/programs/early-intervention/\">intervention</a> (EIPIC programme for children below 7 years old)</li>\n 	<li>Special education schools (SPED schools)</li>\n 	<li>Family support</li>\n 	<li>Transition services</li>\n 	<li>Day programs</li>\n 	<li>Housing options</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nGiven proper support, people with Intellectual Disability are capable of fulfilling successful and productive roles in society. A diagnosis is, more often than not, merely a tool to determine the individual’s eligibility for services and protection of rights, such as special education services, home and community services. It is, by no means, an indication that the individual’s capabilities and potential are limited.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nDisabilities, A. A.

Aside from keeping us alive and going, food does a lot of wonder in our body that we may never know. As to the saying “You are what you eat”, the food that we eat reflects us as a person. Thus, it’s very important for us to have a proper and healthy diet. Aside from its physiological effects, food also affects our emotional and mental well being. In fact, a proper diet can also help people especially the children with learning disabilities.\n\nHere are some of the food beneficial for people who have learning difficulties:\n\n<strong>Eggs and dairy products</strong> – eggs have a lot of proteins and amino acids that is good for our health. It contains <strong><em>choline</em> </strong>- an essential nutrient that helps the brain and the nervous system function properly. Eggs and dairy products also contain <strong><em>methionin</em></strong><em>e</em>- an essential amino acid that affects behavior and learning.\n\n<strong>Chicken, Pork and beef</strong> – meat is a great source of protein and iron, but it also contains <strong><em>zinc</em></strong> which is very important for brain tissues. <strong><em>Zinc</em></strong> protects the brain from stress that leads to aging or slow processing. These type of food helps fight Zinc deficiency that is commonly found in children with dyslexia.\n\n<strong>Soy Milk</strong> – Soymilk is the best substitute as milk for children who are lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant may cause physical and mental problems to children who are suffering from this, so soymilk is the best remedy. It also contains calcium that is essential in strengthening and development of bones and teeth.\n\n<strong>Broccoli</strong> - broccoli is rich in nutrients that helps in memory retention. It is also a source of <strong><em>Vitamin C, beta-carotene, magnesium and calcium. </em></strong>\n\n<strong>Fish<em> (</em>mackerel, salmon and trout)</strong> – these types of fished are rich in <strong><em>omega-3 acids</em></strong> that are good for brain development and visual acuity.\n\n<em>   </em>As parents, it’s your responsibility to check what you’re feeding them. Know whether they are allergic to certain food and avoid giving them processed food in their diet.\n\nWhile it is known that learning difficulties cannot be cured it is possible to mitigate its effects. It’s still good to consider certain measures such as maintaining a proper diet to help reduce its symptoms. A proper and healthy diet does not only give us a sound body but also a sound mind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>References</h1>\nCarlson, Amanda. 2017. <em>Foods that May Help Children with Learning Disabilities.</em> March 15.

Ironically, people with LD is not as perceived but rather that they learn at a slower pace and in a different manner from the rest. In this article, we are going to clarify what exactly is a learning difficulty and how having a learning difficulty is not a measure of one’s intelligence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Learning difficulties</strong> is a term used to describe a condition that interferes with the ability of an individual to learn academic skills. People with learning difficulties normally have difficulty in reading, writing, speaking, language comprehension and problem solving. Learning difficulties often remain unnoticed until the individual starts attending school and portray repeated failures in his/her academic performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough it is usually mistaken as intellectual fault, having a learning disability is not related to an individual’s intellectual capability. People with learning difficulties tend to score within the normal range of IQ functioning on an IQ test.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is an IQ test?</strong>\n\nMost may know what an IQ test is but do not have an in-depth understanding of it. Basically, IQ is a total score added up from different tests that are designed to assess the general intellectual ability of an individual. The most common test used worldwide is the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) (Saklofske, Weiss, Beal, &amp; Coalson, 2003). The Wechsler tests have long been regarded by the scientific community as the go-to test in IQ testing (Meyer &amp; Weaver, 2005).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe WISC test is organized into five components – Verbal Comprehension Index, Visual Spatial Index, Fluid Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index (Wechsler, 2014). These five components will then provide scores for Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ based on comparisons to the mean average score of their same-age peers (Wechsler, 2014). The test requires physical manipulation of objects in front of the psychologist who is conducting the test. As such, a legitimate IQ test cannot be taken online. Each component of the test starts off with easy tasks and progressively gets more difficult.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe WISC test is also used to measure cognitive abilities relevant to assessing and identifying specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia and dyscalculia (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010), as well as a child’s cognitive development with respect to their chronological age (Wechsler, 2014).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn fact, though people with learning difficulties struggle with reading, writing, mathematics and comprehension, they often excel in different fields that rely on other skills such as analytical thinking, illustration and acting. Some notable people who have learning difficulties are Picasso, Albert Einstein and Walt Disney.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are several types of classification for learning difficulties\n<ul>\n 	<li>Dyslexia – difficulty in reading and language processing abilities</li>\n 	<li>Dyscalculia – difficulty in understanding and solving mathematical equations</li>\n 	<li>Dysgraphia – difficulty in handwriting skills i.e. in written expression</li>\n 	<li>Dyspraxia – difficulty in activities requiring coordination and movement</li>\n 	<li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</li>\n 	<li>Others – APD (Auditory processing disorder), SLPD (specific language processing disorder), Non-verbal learning difficulties, Language impairment</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nHopefully, this article has clarified some doubts and misconceptions that people might have about learning difficulties and intelligence. Having a learning difficulty merely means that your brain processes information differently that resulted in a slower pace than the rest. They just require a longer time to arrive at the same understanding that we do whenever we encounter a problem.\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nSaklofske, D., Weiss, L., Beal, A.

(3273, 1, '2018-12-26 06:12:48', '2018-12-26 06:12:48', 'Memory is a very important component related to learning. By definition, it is the process of storing or encoding information we have acquired through learning. Before moving forward, let’s take note of the difference between learning and memory. <strong>Learning</strong> is the acquisition of knowledge or information whereas <strong>memory</strong> is the storing of the information you have acquired. Memory is vital in our everyday lives. It allows us to practice knowledge and life skills that we have learnt in order to perform our day-to-day activities efficiently. Thus, having a good memory is important.\n\nA good memory is crucial especially for children who are of school-going age. The demand placed on children in terms of memorising things is much higher than the demand placed on adults because children are at an age whereby, they are constantly learning new things from their environment. They are constantly being bombarded with information about different topics for almost every day of the week (Thorne, 2006).  However, there are some children, particularly those who have learning difficulties, who struggle to remember things. They have trouble retaining information efficiently, especially if they are not interested about the topic, thus affecting their success in academic achievements.\n\nBelow are a few listed tips that you can practice in order to help children with learning difficulties to develop and improve their memory:\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Getting enough sleep</strong></li>\n</ol>\nSleep is an important key to learning and memory, and not having enough sleep every night does a lot of damage to our brains. Research has shown that <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/getting-better-sleep.htm\">sleep</a> is necessary for memory consolidation, with the key memory-enhancing activity occurring during the deepest stages of sleep<em> (Smith &amp; Robinson, 2018)</em>. As such, try to ensure that your child gets 9 to 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep daily and be sure to follow a regular sleeping and waking time schedule for your child.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Engage in physical activities</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAerobics and cardiovascular exercises are also good for the brain. It helps to produce more oxygen that keeps the brain healthy and helps prevent memory loss. Engaging in physical activities that requires hand-eye coordination or complex motor skills have shown to be particularly beneficial for brain building (Smith &amp; Robinson, 2018).\n\nAdding physical activities to aid memorization is also a tip. For some people, they memorise their notes better when they re-type or re-write it out. This method of memorising is called kinesthetics learning in which students learn more efficiently when they are engaged in some form of physical activities (Hoover, 2009).\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Review before going to bed</strong></li>\n</ul>\nFor children who are of school-going age, reviewing notes before going to bed is one of the best strategies for memorising.  Any information you have studied are best remembered when you review them before sleeping.  But be sure that the review is done as the absolute last thing before bed as any other task that is performed after reviewing and prior to sleeping (such as getting a snack, brushing teeth, listening to music) will interfere with the consolidation of information in memory<em> (Thorne, 2006)</em>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Brain-boosting diet</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTrue to the saying “you are what you eat”, everything that we eat does make a difference to our body. Thus, having a healthy and nutritious diet is important.  In order to boost your memory, foods that are rich in Omega 3 acids are highly recommended (Smith &amp; Robinson, 2018). Omege-3 acid can be found in fatty seafoods like mackerel, trout and salmon. It can also be found in walnuts and soybeans. Green tea and fruits are also rich in antioxidants that help protect the brain from damages.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Substitute technical words with visual cues</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWhen memorizing, children might encounter difficult words and concepts. Another technique that might help is by using visual cues. You can substitute technical words and concepts with visual cues so it can be easily remembered (Hoover, 2009). Young children tend to be more of a visual learner. For example, if you want to teach your child the meaning of the words ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’, it is easier to show them pictures of clean and dirty objects rather than explaining the meaning of clean and dirty, expecting them to remember the long string of words and being able to identify clean and dirty objects from the meaning you have provided.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Read aloud</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe more you read verbally, the more the idea stays in your memory. Rehearsing your speech verbally helps you to remember your speech better (Hoover, 2009). It allows for higher chances of memory recall.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Be an active reader</strong></li>\n</ul>\nReading stimulates our memory. Being an active reader helps us improve our memory. Teach your child to pay more attention to the meaning of the words when reading. Students remember and retain stories better when they underline, highlight or jot down keywords about the material (Thorne, 2006).\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Practice and repeat</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe best way to learn and memorise things is through consistent practice. Constantly doing practise and revision allows you child to apply what they have learned. You can do it repeatedly until they have understood the entire concept. One of the golden rules of learning and memory is constant repetition. The brain also responds better to novelty, so repeating something in a different way or at a different time will make the memory more vivid and allow you to build stronger memories about the new thing (Smith &amp; Robinson, 2018).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are many other tips regarding memory improvement available on the Internet. But do not blindly follow all the tips suggested as some tips may be effective for your child but some may not. One important thing to consider is what kind of a learning style (auditory, visual, reading/writing, kinesthetics) does your child respond best so you will be able to pick out the most appropriate teaching strategies to help your child. And of course, when in doubt, always make sure to consult professionals.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nThorne, G. (2006, May 1). <em>10 Strategies to Enhance Students\' Memory</em>.

(3278, 1, '2019-01-03 03:52:16', '2019-01-03 03:52:16', 'The ages of 3-6 is the most crucial developmental stage for children. It is where they start learning important life skills such as communication and problem-solving as well as developing psycho-social and motor skills. It is extremely critical that parents closely monitor their child’s development during this stage. Any noticeable delays in the child’s development may have a long-term and negative impact on his learning and social interactions skills. This delay can be mitigated if the child is brought to the paediatrician for an early assessment and identification of issues, and enrolled in an early intervention program in order to help them meet their developmental milestones.\n\n<strong>What is early intervention?</strong>\n\nEarly intervention services are programs that help young children build key foundational developmental skills in the areas of physical, cognitive, communication, social and emotion development. It applies to children as early as 0 to 6 years old.  In an interview with Jan Matthews, a psychologist at Parenting Research Centre in Australia, she states that “early intervention starts with early identification of what issues are concerned with the child, and it’s putting in place programs and services that would meet the needs of the child in a timely way but also taking into account what the family requires to support this child” (Matthews, 2016). Early intervention is not only about helping the child but also about guiding the parents or the family on the best ways to support them.\n\n<strong>What are the benefits of early intervention?</strong>\n\nAlthough some parents believe that their children will eventually overcome the difficulties that they face during the developmental stage, there are still children that eventually do not meet their developmental milestones and went on to be diagnosed with developmental delays or some form of learning disorder. As such, it is still important not to leave it to chance and take actions as early as possible. As cliché as it may sound, the earlier it is, the better when it comes to early intervention. To further understand the importance of early intervention, below are some of the benefits of early intervention to the child and the family:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Children with learning difficulties often exhibit a lack of communication skills. They struggle to express their feelings and to communicate with others effectively, which affects their relationship with their family and their peers. Early intervention focuses on teaching the child how to mitigate their lack of communication skills. “Communication development sets the stage for literacy and influences later success in school” (First Word Project, Florida State University, 2015)</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Early intervention also helps to improve the child’s behaviour. Children with learning difficulties often portray negative behaviours as result of their condition and their frustration in not being able to express themselves fluently. They often throw tantrums and act violently in a bid to show their frustration or because they are unable to control their impulses. Early intervention provides support for children on how they can manage their emotions through different activities.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>Apart from benefiting the child, early intervention also helps parents learn different methods and techniques on how they could support their child at home. A child’s development is a collaborative effort between the professionals and parents.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe saying ‘an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure’ also applies in early intervention. It is better to keep an eye on your child’s development and to identify potential development issues so intervention can be done as early as possible in order to give your child a better platform to perform as they grow. If you observe any learning or social delays in your child’s development, do not hesitate to consult <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/programs/early-intervention/\">professionals</a>. There is nothing wrong in being overly-cautious when it comes to your child’s development. Start any form of intervention as early as possible and you will see the benefits of it in later years.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nFirst Word Project, Florida State University.

(3281, 1, '2019-01-09 02:23:59', '2019-01-09 02:23:59', 'School can be exhausting for children and it is even more difficult for children with learning difficulties.  Having lessons every day where they are being bombarded with information can be too tiring for a young child. Knowing that children naturally have a shorter attention span and are easily distracted, at a certain point after long hours of learning, their attention will wane, and they will eventually lose interest and focus.\n\nGiving them a break from school work and lessons is important. It is good to let them engage in non-academic activities. Given that they face difficulties in academe, co-curricular activities can be their avenue to unleash the hidden potential within them. Orlando Bloom, Walt Disney, Keira Knightley, Michael Phelps, Steven Spielberg… These are just some notable people who grew up with learning difficulties but are successful in different fields such as theater, music and sports.\n\nTo help your child, especially for those who have learning difficulties, to de-stress from school and explore fields outside the academe, here are some activities that they may enjoy and at the same time can be beneficial for their growth:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Music</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWho doesn’t love Music? Music is a universal language. Its’ effect on us is unexplainably beautiful and it sets our mood. Research have shown that people who learn music tend to have improved executive functioning skills, which is an area that children with <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/adhd-2/learning-difficulties/\">ADHD</a> often struggle with (Csillag, 2015). So in a way, learning music is constructive and therapeutic for children with ADHD.\n\nWhile it may be difficult for children with dyslexia to learn music since they often struggle to make sense of the musical notes, researchers argue that it can, instead, be helpful for them. Not only is learning music a fun and more relaxed way of listening to and producing changes in sound, it can also improve the child’s ability to process speech sounds as children with dyslexia often struggle with creating the connection between the sound of the word with the actual word itself (Kelly, 2018). Helping them to consciously create that sound-word connection and continuously reinforcing it can help build the child’s reading skills and improve their phonemic awareness (Kelly, 2018).\n\nLearning music doesn’t necessarily need to be in the form of singing. You can allow them to explore playing different kinds of instruments – guitar, piano, drums, violin, as well as song composition\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Sports</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSports is always a fun activity to engage in after a long day at school because all children love to run around and play. Researchers argue that sports is beneficial for children with learning difficulties because it develops their sense of engagement, their ability to follow instructions and their capacity to perform a task<em>.</em> Research have also shown that engaging in sports instil a level of discipline in the child, which reduces the behavioural symptoms that are commonly associated with children with ADHD. This reduction in behavioural symptoms can then allow them to better concentrate during lessons and exhibit better academic performance (Csillag, 2015).\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Visual Arts</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAllowing your child to practise in visual arts is another avenue as well. It represents one more way for them to communicate effectively whatever it is that they struggle to express because of their condition.  It is also another way for them to unleash their creativity and to hone their creative thinking skill, a skill that many children with learning difficulties struggle to learn as their brains view things linearly and figuratively, as such, they struggles to come up with ideas that requires them to think out-of-the-box.\n\nActivities such as painting, and colouring are often used as therapeutic measures to help children with autism manage their emotions and to channel it into a different outlet. Moreover, thinking visually is a strength that many children with learning difficulties possess. Being able to express themselves with visual work rather than written work can be a confidence booster for them (Csillag, 2015).\n\nSchool environment can be competitive and very challenging for children, especially those with learning difficulties, to keep up. Providing them with co-curricular activities is one way for them to explore their hidden talents and unleash their potential. They may not excel academically but if they are able to discover something that they love doing and are good in it, it builds their self-esteem and allows them to grow to be confident young people.\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nCsillag, J.

(3314, 1, '2019-01-16 01:42:05', '2019-01-16 01:42:05', 'The last thing that children would want to do after a long day at school is homework. It is difficult to make them do their homework because they are often too tired from school and other co-curricular activities. They are also distracted by the games and other forms of entertainment at home. This is a real challenge for parents because it often starts dispute between them and their children especially when their children refuse to do their homework. However, it is important to know that while doing homework merely feels like completing a task just because it was assigned by the school, homework does play an important role in the learning process of children.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li>Homework teaches children to be independent, to take initiative and responsibility for completing a task, and it helps children to develop a sense of self-discipline. Doing school work at home helps the children to practice working alone without asking for help from their classmates and teachers.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Homework teaches children to be resourceful. As they must do things on their own, they have to learn how to use available sources of information at home such as the internet and books. This boost their confidence in independent problem-solving and in handling situations alone in the future. This also improves their research skills and exposes them to wider range of learning through the usage of additional materials.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>Homework gives an opportunity for parents to monitor their children’s academic progress. Throughout the years, research studies have consistently shown that parental involvement in a child\'s learning is an important factor in determining a child\'s achievement in school. Homework allows parents to have an active role in their child\'s education and helps them to evaluate and monitor their child\'s progress. Moreover, the process of doing homework also provides an extra venue for parents to interact and bond with their child.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>Homework allows children recap on the skills, concepts and information that they have learned in class. They get to practice on what they have learned and apply it in their homework. This continuous process of recap and application would provide a stronger reinforcement regarding the information and would allow for a stronger retention of information in their minds and make learning more efficient.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, as much as doing homework contributes to the learning process of children, it must also be noted that too much homework can cause them stress and exhaustion. Too much pressure can lead to debilitating effects on the child’s health and mental psyche. A child’s health should not be compromised just for the sake of doing homework. As the saying goes “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.” Allowing them a 15-minute break in between each task makes a vast difference in the child’s concentration and attention levels towards the tasks.\n\nIt must also be noted that homework that are out of their depth will cause the child to lose interest and confidence in the subject. They will feel that no one provide help for them and no matter how hard they try, they are just going to get the questions wrong. So, it is advisable that whenever your child is learning something new in school, take time to sit with them and go through the homework first before allowing them to complete the rest of the homework independently. Don’t forget to also check in on their homework progress every once in a while and help them out. There might be a few things that they have forgotten, or they don’t feel confident enough to attempt independently so it will be good to let the child know that you are always ready to help them and that they are not alone.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>Homework Support Program</strong> (Please <a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/contact-us/\">click here</a> to contact us about this service from Cognitive)\n\nHomework Support Program is a service provided to assist children in their homework. The service includes giving additional activities and learning materials for children to help them fully understand the various skills and concepts that they have learnt in school. It also provides a platform for constant revision to take place and allows the child to constantly revise and reinforce on the information that they have learnt before. This program is ideal for families whereby both parents are working. It also provides parents with more opportunities to build and maintain a harmonious relationship with their child because parents will be free from the worries and frustrations regarding their child’s homework issues, thus lessening the probability for arguments to take place.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nAtkinson, J.

They encounter a lot more challenges every day that might test their patience and self-control as such, they feel more exhausted than typical parents. According to an article published in Boston University’s website, a <a href=\"http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/11/10/autism-moms-stress/6121/\">recent study</a> found that mothers of adolescents and adults with autism had levels of stress hormones that are comparable to that of soldiers in combat (BU Faculty &amp; Staff Assistance Office, 2018).\n\nThe typical causes of stress for these parents are:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Financial problems occurring from frequent clinic visits and therapies for the children</li>\n 	<li>Fear and worry about the children’s sufferings</li>\n 	<li>Concerns about the children’s future</li>\n 	<li>Feeling of resentment as a parent for thoughts of being a bad parent or for doing something wrong which led to your child developing this disability</li>\n</ul>\nParents, though these stressors are valid concerns and though it is your duty to take care and provide for your children, do not let it consume you and forget about taking care of your own personal needs. Good parenting is one that recognizes self-care because you would not be able to take care of your kids if you do not take care of yourself at the same time.\n\nIn order to help you navigate the challenges that comes with parenting a child with special needs, here are some advice you might want to consider:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Reinforce positivity</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAvoid comparing your child or yourself to other people because everyone has a different disposition. Look past on what is lacking, learn to recognize what you have, where you are and then do something about it. Having a positive outlook on life makes a lot of difference. Being the one who leads the household, everything you do affects the whole family. Your attitude towards their condition reflects how they will see themselves. If you are someone who reinforces positivity and believes that there is a bright future beyond their disabilities, then they will be encouraged and be confident in themselves.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Join a support group</strong></li>\n</ul>\nBeing a parent of a child with special needs, you may sometimes feel overwhelmed and alone.  It may be difficult to share your questions and your problems about your child with your friends as they might not be able to relate to the situation. Having a support group is therefore essential as you can share your questions and problems with them because you are in the same boat as everybody else in the group. Having someone or a group to discuss things with and to draw support from is a comforting thought and you can even learn from them through shared experiences. You can join support groups in your community or even online. It is good to be connected with people whom you can relate to.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Learn more about your child’s condition</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSome parents are highly dependent on the doctors’ or therapists’ opinions regarding their child’s condition. There is nothing wrong with that, but their opinions are often generalized and might not be suitable to your child’s current needs. As parents, you should also learn more about their condition because no one knows your children better than you do. It is very important for you to be involved in this matter, not only for your child but also for yourself. Do research, read books and articles related to their condition, go to online groups set up by parents in the similar situation as you.  Being educated about the condition allows you to understand your children and the condition better and at the same time, reduces the uncertainty and anxiety.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nBU Faculty &amp; Staff Assistance Office.

However, giving out criticisms is not as simple as it sounds especially when it comes to young children. No matter how you put it, constructive criticism is still criticism.\n\nChildren are very sensitive. Whatever you say greatly affects the way they view themselves. Instances may occur where you have unintentionally hurt their feelings while trying to discipline them. Sometimes, what we think as constructive criticism may turn out to be not as “constructive” to them. Things like these will have an impact on your child’s emotional well-being as they grow up and may also compromise your relationship with them.\n\nIn order to reinforce discipline in your child without compromising your relationship with them, here are some suggestions you can use to give out effective constructive criticisms:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Identify the cause of the problem</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe first step of every solution is always going back to the root of the problem. Before criticizing your child, first, find out the reason behind their action. Always go to the main root of the problem – they may be imitating what they see their friends have been doing in school or it might just be a cry for attention as they feel neglected.\n\nIn identifying the cause of the problem, you are then able to make a better and more well-informed decision based on the facts that you have found out.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Do not yell, scold or call them names</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSometimes when you are exhausted after a long and tiring day at work, you cannot help but be annoyed at every small thing that is going wrong. As such, when your child makes a mistake, it is easy to lose your temper on them. However, scolding them only makes the situation worse. No matter how wound up you are, you must control your anger and do not let your temper cloud your judgement. Always remember that you are dealing with a child, not an adult. Children have feelings too and no one, especially children, likes hearing criticism in a hostile manner.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Do not criticize them in public</strong></li>\n</ul>\nNever criticize your children in front of other people. Doing this may cause a negative impact on their psychological well-being. Try to reprimand them in private but always make an effort to praise them in public.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Find the right time to talk to them</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThere are instances that you do not need to react right away. Sometimes, it might be better to delay the criticism. You might say hurtful words that you do not mean in a moment of anger and no matter how hard you try, it is impossible to take back words that have already been said. Always adopt a calm and rational disposition when talking to your child about the mistake they have made. In this way, you will also be calmer and be able to deliver a better message to your child and the chances of your child hearing this message increases.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Sandwich method</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<strong> </strong>\n\nThis method is the most common strategy in giving out criticisms.  As the method suggests<em>,</em> you sandwich the negative criticism with compliments.  For instance, if your child failed an exam, you can try to talk to him first by praising him for the effort he has placed into the exam. Then, you raise the issue to them but be sure to constantly assure them that no matter the outcome, you are still rooting for them and you still love them. End off by encouraging them to do better next time. In this manner, the child will be set at ease with the knowledge that his/her parents understand their situation and thus, they will be able to take the criticism in a constructive manner.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sandwich.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3349\" src=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sandwich-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"sandwich method\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Make them realize the consequences of their mistake</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIt is also important to let your child know why you are criticizing them. Make sure they understand that what distresses you is their behaviour and not themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Do not focus on the mistake, focus on the lesson learned from it and apply it into the future</strong></li>\n</ul>\nOne of the common mistakes that parents make when giving out criticisms to their children is that they focus too much on the damage rather than the solution. Remember that you are giving criticisms because you want them to learn, not blame them. You are only making them feel bad about themselves by dwelling on the mistakes and not moving forward.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Allow them to correct themselves</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAfter the criticism, allow your child time and space to improve themselves. The ultimate goal of constructive criticism is to prompt your children to realize their mistakes and to make the appropriate corrections. In this way, the child will learn to take responsibilities of their own actions in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGiving criticisms is a sensitive issue and it is not easy to do especially to your child. However, it also plays an important role in reinforcing discipline in them. What is important is that you make them understand the purpose and the reason behind your criticism.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nKabir, S.

For some people, they even consider their pets as part of the family. We can go on listing the benefits of having pets at home, but one thing that most people do not know about is that pets also have a huge influence on children with special needs. Yes, you read it right. Owning a pet can be helpful to children who have special needs. Below are some reasons why:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Children with ADHD have difficulties in developing routine due to their short attention span. They easily get distracted and are often unable to finish a task because they face great difficult in focusing on one activity at a time. For children with ADHD, owning a pet can help them develop a sense of consistency and discipline. Taking care of a pet requires them to create a fixed schedule on when to feed, bathe and play with them. Implementing a daily routine can create better habits, such as the ability to make a plan and stick to it, which is something that children with ADHD struggle greatly with. A daily routine involving a pet provides a satisfying alternative to merely creating a strict personal time regimen, and it also gives you a partner to face the day with (Kledzik, 2018).</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/child-with-pets.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3362 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/child-with-pets-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"child with pet\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a></p>\n2. Children who has learning difficulties often feel isolated because they are often unable to find people who can relate to their struggles, as such, they find it difficult to make friends and socialize. Having a pet could ease their loneliness. Pets, especially dogs, are often described as man’s best friend. They are innocent and non-judgmental creatures who can lend you a listening ear, comfort you and relieve your stress. Dogs are a wonderful source of support and can also help to increase an individual’s ability to cope with struggles in their lives (Kledzik, 2018).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nKledzik, K.

Everyone, from toddlers to the elderly, has easy access to it and often times, they are so engrossed in their devices that they forget what is happening around them. In this article, I am going to highlight exactly what Screen Dependency Disorder is and who does it affect the most.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs adults, we often forget that there are people around us who are observing our every action. By people, I don’t mean our peers but rather, toddlers and young children. At such a young and impressionable age, they are easily influenced by the environment around them as they are growing and learning information. When we are constantly looking at our devices, young children will be curious to know what exactly we are looking at and they in turn, might even mimic the behaviour as they think that it is the norm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChildren are often fascinated by the moving images and music in the videos shown on their screens. As such, they are often happy and quiet to have a device in their hands. Most parents will feel relieved by this as they are able to keep their child entertained and out of trouble, and at the same time, they are able to do some of their work without having to wait till late in the evening when their child is asleep in order to do it. However, do you know that excessive screen time is actually detrimental to young children?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecent studies have consistently shown a relationship between the amount of screen time a child receives and their language development. A greater amount of screen time has shown to cause a decrease in words and sentences that toddlers and young children use, therefore resulting in delayed language development. A study done in Canada on almost 900 young children between the age of six months and two years found that toddlers who were exposed to more handheld screen time were more likely to have delayed expressive language skills (i.e. the child’s ability to say words and sentences were delayed). They also found that for every 30 minutes increase in handheld screen time, there was a 49% increase in risk of expressive language delay. Another study which surveyed more than 1000 parents of children under the age of two found that toddlers who watched more videos said fewer words. For each additional hour of videos that eight to sixteen month old infants watched in a day, they said an average of six to eight fewer words.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTaking into account the overwhelming evidence of the detriments of screen time, the Canadian Paediatric Society suggests that for infants and toddlers under 2 years of age, it is highly discouraged that they be exposed to any form of screen time at all. As for children from the ages of 2 to 5, it is acceptable to expose them to some form of screen time but it must be noted that the total amount of screen time they are exposed to should be under one hour per day.\n\nDuring screen time, it is suggested that parents sit together with the child to talk about what they are watching. This will help the child to create a better understanding of what is happening in the video and they will be better able to use the lessons learnt in the video in their daily lives.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn lieu of screen time, it is highly recommended that parents engaged their children in play instead. Playing with items such as lego blocks, bubbles and engaging in pretend play activities are beneficial in terms of fine-tuning the child’s gross and fine motor skills, as well as expanding their concept on imaginative play. Another activity that is highly recommended is storybook reading. Storybooks with little words and big and colourful pictures are useful in engaging the child’s attention. Storybook reading helps to expand the child’s vocabulary and sentence-making skills. Parents can also use this chance to use simple words to explain the picture and the characters in it. (e.g. Look at the dog! It looks cute. The dog is sleeping under the tree. What sound do you think the dog make?)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe saying “It takes a whole village to raise a child” holds true. A lot of effort is placed in raising up a child and no shortcuts should be taken. How well a child grows up is determined by the amount of care and attention that the parents put into the child during their growing up years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBibliography\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li><a href=\"http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles/ipad-equals-dont-talk.aspx\">http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles/ipad-equals-dont-talk.aspx</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=\"https://jicna.org/index.php/journal/article/view/67/pdf\">https://jicna.org/index.php/journal/article/view/67/pdf</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=\"http://www.afahc.ro/ro/afases/2018/43-CristinaBalan.pdf\">http://www.afahc.ro/ro/afases/2018/43-CristinaBalan.pdf</a></li>\n</ol>', 'Screen Dependency Disorder', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'screen-dependency-disorder', '', '', '2019-02-13 02:38:32', '2019-02-13 02:38:32', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3376', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(3454, 1, '2019-02-20 02:46:32', '2019-02-20 02:46:32', 'People say that reading is like feeding your soul. Reading can take you to places and it can teach you a lot of things. It develops your understanding and knowledge about a wide range of topics from literature, science, medicine, world phenomenon, culture differences, etc. Reading can also help to increase your vocabulary.\n\nHowever, not everyone enjoys reading. There are people who just do not like to read and we cannot blame them. For those who are outgoing and adventurous, having to sit in a corner for hours with a book in their hands would sound so boring. This is especially true for young children who love to play and move around. Although it is tough to engage young children in books and reading, it is crucial to help them develop a love for reading.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of reading in your children as listed in cameverlands.org.uk’s website:\n\n•<strong> Reading increases their vocabulary and language skills –</strong> Reading gets them to learn new words and phrases that they have never encountered before. By reading these new words and phrases in books, children get to see how these words and phrases are being used in a sentence and it generates an innate curiosity in them to want to learn more about what these words and phrases mean so they will be able to better understand the entire story that they are reading. By actively seeking out what these words and phrases mean, there is now a higher tendency for these new words and phrases to remain in the child’s memory and will thus, be added to their vocabulary.\n\n<strong>• Reading helps children perform better in school –</strong> Reading helps children to excel in all other subjects, not just English. “Children who are good readers tend to achieve better across the curriculum.” (Cam Everland Primary School, 2018)\n\n<strong>• Reading provides an exercise to their brain and develops their imagination</strong> – When you read, your brain is also at work. All the words and descriptions you read are all being translated by the brain into different pictures, feelings and thoughts, thus expanding on your imaginative skills. Children can then use this knowledge to boost their creativity thinking skills when engaging in pretend play.\n\n<strong>• Reading increase their awareness and knowledge of the world around them</strong> – Reading also gives provides an opportunity for children to learn more about other cultures, activities or events that they have never experienced before.\n\n<strong>• Reading helps children to focus</strong> – Reading requires you to stay still and concentrate on the reading material in order to understand and be able to follow the story that is being told. Reading could help children develop their focus and concentration.\n\nNow that we have mentioned the benefits of reading, the next question is ‘how do you go about cultivating a love for reading in your child?’ The job is easier said than done especially for parents whose children are just not interested in reading. You cannot force them to read if they do not want to. However, you can try to develop this skill over time.\n\nHere are some tips on how you could help to develop your child’s love for reading:\n\n<strong>• Read to them</strong> – As traditional as it is, reading to your children as early as prenatal stage is the first step in getting them to develop a love for reading. Bedtime stories were not named as such for no apparent reason. Set aside some time before your child goes to sleep and read to them.\n\n<strong>• Keep books around the house</strong> – Make books easily accessible to children. As the saying goes ‘out of sight, out of mind’. You would not be able to get them to start reading if they do not see any books around them. Children are curious and are more likely to pick up anything they see around them.\n\n<strong>• Never force your preferences on them</strong> – As parents, you may prefer your child to read educational books instead of comics or fiction, but you cannot force your preferences on them. “Children will enjoy books a lot more if they are allowed to choose the books themselves.” (Little Academy of Humble, 2018). You can only guide or suggest books to them but never force them to read a book that you like.\n\n<strong>• Provide a comfortable reading nook</strong> – Having a comfortable and cozy reading nook that is warm and inviting would make your child more willing to read. A quiet reading corner or a mini library in the house could promote reading in the household.\n\n<strong>• Set an example</strong> – Children like to copy what their parents are doing. If they see you reading, they would also want to do the same. If you want your child to do something, you got to set an example first.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Bibliography</strong>\nLittle Academy of Humble. (2018, May 14).

(3464, 1, '2019-02-27 01:37:35', '2019-02-27 01:37:35', 'As children start to learn how to write, it is inevitable that they will commit some writing errors. It is part and parcel of the learning process. However, parents should be also cautious at this stage of learning and to closely monitor your child’s progress. If these writing errors continue to occur for a long period of time, it might signify that there are some underlying issues that your child is unable to overcome on their own.\n\n<strong>What is dysgraphia</strong>\n\nYou may not have encountered this word often, but <strong>dysgraphia</strong> is a condition where a person’s writing abilities is affected. Dysgraphia is characterized by a difficulty in expressing thoughts in written format and having poor and slow handwriting. But do take note that having poor handwriting does not automatically mean you have dysgraphia. Dysgraphia is a more than just having poor handwriting.\n\n<strong>2 types of dysgraphia</strong>\n\nDysgraphia can be categorized into two types: <strong>language-based,</strong> and <strong>non-language-based. Non-language</strong>-<strong>based </strong>dysgraphia is caused by a dysfunction in the motor skills that is required for writing. On the other hand<strong>, language-based dysgraphia</strong> is caused by impairments in the language composition of writing such as difficulty transforming sounds and words into written form. (Dyslexia - SPELD Foundation, 2014)\n\n<strong>Dysgraphia and other learning difficulties</strong>\n\nDysgraphia can be either diagnosed as a stand-alone condition or together with other learning difficulties such as ADHD and dyslexia. As a matter of fact, dysgraphia and dyslexia do sometimes overlap because they are both a form of language disorder and they share similar characteristics. What makes the two different is that, people with dysgraphia can read fluently. Dyslexia affects the person’s reading ability because of the mix ups and struggles in converting alphabets into phonemes while dysgraphia only affects the person’s writing abilities as they have difficulty in terms of writing or transforming alphabets into graphemes (sounds in written form). Children with ADHD can also portray some characteristics of dysgraphia. “Since handwriting skills require memory for the movement path for each letter as well as for how letters connect, children with working memory and/or attention deficits can have difficulty mastering handwriting skills.” (Lunney, 2015)\n\n<strong>Symptoms of dysgraphia</strong>\n\nIn her article <em>Understanding Dysgraphia</em>, Erica divided the symptoms of dysgraphia into six categories namely: visual-spatial, fine motor, language processing, spelling/handwriting, grammar, and organization of language. (Patino, 2018)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Visual-Spatial Difficulties</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Difficulty in identifying shapes and letter spacing</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in organizing words from left to right</li>\n 	<li>Writing letters in different directions</li>\n 	<li>Overlapping letters and words on the same page</li>\n 	<li>Difficultly in writing on the line and inside the margin</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in reading maps and drawing shapes</li>\n 	<li>Rewriting and copying texts from the whiteboard</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Fine Motor Difficulties</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Poor at holding the pen correctly</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in doing other activities that involves the hands or fingers such as tracing, tying shoes, doing puzzles and typing</li>\n 	<li>Poor at colouring or using the scissors within the line</li>\n 	<li>Places hand at an awkward position when writing</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Language Processing Issues</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Difficulty in writing ideas down</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in understanding rules and instructions</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in following directions</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Spelling Issues/Handwriting Issues</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Able to verbally spell a word correctly but make errors in writing</li>\n 	<li>Poor at identifying misspelled words from the correct spelling words</li>\n 	<li>Mixes up small and capital letters</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in reading his own writing</li>\n 	<li>Frequently erases his work and rewrite</li>\n 	<li>Poor writing stamina</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Grammar and Usage Problems</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Incorrect usage of punctuations</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in writing down complete sentences</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Organization of Written Language</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Better in verbally telling stories than writing stories down</li>\n 	<li>Sentences get jumbled up when writing</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in converting train of ideas to written form</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Diagnosis and treatment</strong>\n\nSymptoms of dysgraphia can be seen as early as the child starts learning. However, it is not easily identifiable because some signs might just be typical of a child who is in the early stages of learning. But should the symptoms continue to persist as the child grows older, it is best to consult a licensed professional. Although dysgraphia is a lifelong learning difficulty, there are therapies available to help people manage their dysgraphia. The earlier you undergo diagnosis and therapy, the better the chances are for the condition to be managed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nLunney, M.

It is highly anticipated by the parents because it is one of the first signs of their child’s speech development.\n\nChildren develop speech at different pace. There are some who learn to talk as early as 12 to 18 months while there are others who take longer time. While such cases are normal for young children, it is still prudent to be cautious of any sign that might lead to more serious problems in the future.\n\nHere are some early signs of speech developmental delays to watch out for according to their ages:\n\n<strong>0 to 12 months</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant does not respond to any sound. </strong>Usually, babies cry when they are being startled by a loud sound. You can also observe responses in terms of body and eye movements when you talk to them. If you do not get any response from them to such sounds, then you may have to check on their hearing. Hearing is a very important component of speech development because children tend to imitate sounds that they hear. If they have difficulty in recognizing sounds, then it might be difficult for them to imitate.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant does not babble. </strong>Babies start to babble at around 4 to 6 months. They begin to utter sounds such as ‘ma-ma’ or ‘da-da’. If they do not start to make such sounds around this age, then they might have a speech delay or difficulty in producing speech.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant does not meet your gaze. </strong>Babies who do not keep eye contact with you when you are talking to them might have difficulty in recognizing sounds. They may appear to be inattentive and uninterested to their surroundings.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>12 to 24 months</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant is unable to say a single word. </strong>Children at this age should be able to say at least few common words.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant is unable to execute bodily gestures like pointing and waving. </strong>Children should be able to exhibit some form of awareness and be able to point at people and objects during this time. Difficulty in pointing to body parts such as head, arms or legs may be a sign of speech delay. Also, during this period, they should be able to wave and clap their hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The infant exhibits limited emotion. </strong>Normally, children during this age will start to show different types of emotion. They will begin to laugh, cry, be playful and get excited. On the other hand, children who are developmentally delayed will portray limited types of emotion. What is obvious is that, they will cry and whimper a lot and they usually appear to be uncomfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>24 to 36 months</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The child is unable to say simple sentences.</strong> They would not be able to say simple sentences to express their feelings or their needs and wants. A child who is developing normally will be able to say simple phrases to express their emotions, needs and wants such as ‘want milk’, ‘don’t want’, ‘carry me’ etc.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The child has trouble in communicating and playing with other children. </strong>Children are more playful during this age and they love to be surrounded by other children. If the child seems to be distant or scared when surrounded by people or other children, he or she might be uncomfortable with something. Although these circumstances do normally happen, it is always better to be cautious especially when the behaviour becomes repetitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>The child has problems in simple reading and writing. </strong>Even before entering pre-school, children during this age are able to recognize pictures and figures in books and draw simple curves and lines. Children who are experiencing delays usually pay no attention to these things.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nDelays in a children development is normal. Some children may learn faster or slower than usual, but it is okay. Again, remember that children develop their own skills uniquely and at their own timing. If you ever experience or observe one or more signs listed above in your children, do not panic. There are always other ways to help them develop these skills. Talking and reading to them continuously as they grow is one great way to begin with. Lastly, if you ever have doubts, you can always consult your paediatrician or professionals that specializes in those areas of development.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>References</h1>\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

(3497, 1, '2019-03-13 06:24:42', '2019-03-13 06:24:42', '<strong>ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)</strong>, commonly known as <strong>Autism</strong>, is one of the most common diagnosis among children. In an article published by Vincent Iannelli, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease and Control Prevention reported that in 2014, 1 out of 68 children are diagnosed with Autism as compared to in 2000 where 1 in 150 children are diagnosed (Vincent Iannelli, 2018).\n\nASD is not easily diagnosed until the child is around 4 years old. This is very unfortunate because by then, it might be too late to get the early intervention needed to improve the child’s condition. However, specialists believe that subtle signs of Autism can be seen among children even before they reach 3 years old.\n\nEarly signs of Autism can be observed as early as the baby turns 6 months. For parents who are concerned if their baby is showing symptoms of Autism or even those who simply want to keep track of their baby’s development, here are some of the subtle signs to look out for:\n\n<strong>0 - 12 months</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>The baby is not making any eye contact especially when you are talking to them.</li>\n 	<li>The baby is not smiling.</li>\n 	<li>The baby does not respond to noises.</li>\n 	<li>The baby is not babbling</li>\n 	<li>The baby is not making any gestures like pointing.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>12 – 24 months</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>The baby is unable to say a single word.</li>\n 	<li>The baby seems to avoid physical contact e.g. arching away when being carried.</li>\n 	<li>The baby does not respond when their name is called.</li>\n 	<li>The baby is distant to peers or lacks social skills.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you observe one or more of the signs listed above, note that it does not necessarily mean your child has ASD. Most of the signs listed above tend to overlap with the symptoms of other developmental disorders.\n\n<strong>When to consult professionals?</strong>\n\nThere is no perfect time or situation to know when to consult experts about your child’s condition. If you observe strange behaviors in your child, trust your instincts and consult an expert right away. Sound out your concerns to the expert and listen to what they might have to say. As the saying goes, it is always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nIt is very important to take early precautions regarding this matter. Whether it is a sign of ASD or other developmental disorders, it should not be taken lightly. If you observe a sign or atypical behaviours in your baby, here are step-by-step recommendations from the website <a href=\"http://www.firstsigns.org\">www.firstsigns.org</a> (Vincent Iannelli, 2018):\n<ul>\n 	<li>Put together a checklist of the developmental milestones you feel your baby is not reaching to share with your pediatrician. Be specific about what you are seeing (or not seeing). For example, \"My baby doesn\'t respond when I say her name\".</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Be clear about your specific concerns. If the doctor suggests taking a wait-and-see approach, ask for a referral to a developmental pediatrician.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>After your child has been screened, ask as many questions as it takes for you to understand the results, what they mean, and how best to proceed.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>If the screening shows your baby may be at risk for developing ASD, follow up. It may be hard to believe or accept this possibility, but do not let your emotions prevent you from getting help as soon as possible. Early intervention may make an enormous difference in how well your child responds to treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<em> </em>\n\n<em> </em>\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nVincent Iannelli, M.

Children with CAS have difficulty in producing sounds not because they do not know what to say but rather their brain is unable to get their speech muscles to move. It is important to note that CAS is not caused by weak muscles; it is more of a dysfunction in the brain processing pathways.\n\n<strong>Apraxia of Speech and Aphasia</strong>\n\nCAS and aphasia can overlap because they are both communication disorders. There is also a possibility that both conditions can occur together. While both share some similar characteristics such as difficulty expressing oneself in words, they have distinct differences in terms of how they affect one’s speaking ability. People with aphasia have difficulty understanding or using words themselves. With aphasia, the problem lies with the comprehension of language. Apraxia, on the other hand, does not involve any problems with the comprehension of language but mainly poor speech muscles coordination.\n\n<strong>Causes and Symptoms</strong>\n\nCAS is a genetic disorder, but it can also be acquired through brain injury if the areas responsible for speech are affected. Children with CAS can be characterized by the following symptoms (Jaganathan, 2018):\n\n<strong>Infants and young children</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Late emergence of the baby’s first word</li>\n 	<li>No cooing or babbling</li>\n 	<li>Missing consonants and vowels when trying to speak and can only say a few consonants and vowels</li>\n 	<li>Simplifying difficult words or omitting difficult sounds</li>\n 	<li>Eating problems</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Older children</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Struggles to produce consonants and vowels</li>\n 	<li>Displays a good comprehension of language but struggles to express themselves</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in saying long words</li>\n 	<li>Shows under- or over-sensitivity in the oral area e.g. may not like brushing or eating crunchy food</li>\n 	<li>May sound monotonous, choppy and places emphasis on the wrong syllables when speaking</li>\n</ul>\n­­­­Symptoms of CAS may vary from case to case and can sometimes overlap with other difficulties. Some of the symptoms listed above do occur in a typical child’s development. However, if these symptoms continue to persist for a long period of time, there is a possibility that it can be a symptom of CAS.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>Can CAS be treated?</strong>\n\nCAS cannot be cured but the condition can be improved through extensive therapies and trainings. However, it will take time and the results depend on the severity of the condition, the therapies and trainings conducted, and the amount of home support given. If you are in any doubt, make sure to seek advice from a professional such as a Speech Therapist in order to understand how best to help your child if your child has CAS.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

The term ‘handicapped’ may sound a little offensive and debilitating to some people and hence, the term ‘person with disability’ should be used instead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Why does it even matter?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLanguage has changed since we started recognising the power of how our words can shape our reality. Whether or not we are aware of it, words convey images that do have an effect on our attitude and behaviour. For example, a word like <em>mentally crazy</em> carries an image that can makes us feel afraid of people with mental illnesses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs such, we need to start avoiding phrases such as ‘victim of cerebral palsy’, ‘suffering from epilepsy’, ‘afflicted with autism’ and ‘confined in a wheelchair’. These phrases imply the person is a tragic martyr; that the person was killed by the disability. In addition, we should also avoid phrases such as ‘bravely battling multiple sclerosis’ as it makes the person sound heroic for having a disability. By using all the phrases, you are objectifying the person with the disability and placing the disability first, rather than the person first.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen describing a person with a disability, it is important to position your words in such a manner that you are putting the person first instead of their disability e.g. instead of <em>blind person</em>, say <em>person with visual impairment</em>, instead of <em>Down Syndrome </em>child, say <em>a child with Down syndrome</em>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we change our words, we are not denying reality or hiding a certain disability but rather, we are doing it to avoid dehumanising stereotypes. People with disabilities just want to be treated and perceived in the same manner as everyone else. They are just like any of us - treat them the way you (a typical developing person) would want to be treated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis idea of person-first language has gained large acceptance among many people with disabilities as well as many professionals who work with them. For example, some people who are hearing impaired (deaf) refer to themselves as Deaf with a capital D because they grew up and live in a community where people have no hearing. As such, deafness is their culture and their identity. Those who prefer small ‘d’ generally have been mainstreamed and live among those who hear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne drawback of this person-first language is that people are worried that they might say the wrong thing or address the person with disability in an offensive manner. As such, people might not even try to interact with the person with disability, which ultimately defeats the purpose of changing our language to a person-first language. However, we need to remember that this current shift towards a positive language will help us understand our peers better. Always try to stay informed about what is consider appropriate and if you are ever in doubt when interacting with people with disabilities, you can simply just ask them which terms they would prefer to be addressed by.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Here are some tips on how to communicate with people with disabilities:</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>When introduced to a person with disability, offer to shake hands. Those who has an artificial limb can usually shake hands.</li>\n 	<li>If you offer for assistance, wait until the offer is accepted. Then listen to or ask for instructions.</li>\n 	<li>Do not be embarrassed if you happen to use common expressions such as ‘see you later’ or ‘did you hear about that’ when in the company of people who are visually or hearing impaired.</li>\n 	<li>Ask questions. Do not be afraid to ask questions when you are unsure of what to do.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Individuals who are visually impaired:</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Speak to the individual as you approach them.</li>\n 	<li>State clearly who you are in a normal tone of voice.</li>\n 	<li>Never touch or distract their service dog without asking the owner first.</li>\n 	<li>Do not attempt to lead the person without asking them first.</li>\n 	<li>Be descriptive when giving directions. Give them information that is visually obvious to individuals who can see.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Individuals who are hard of hearing / hearing impaired:</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Gain the person’s attention before starting a conversation.</li>\n 	<li>If the individual uses a sign language interpreter, speak directly to the person and not the interpreter.</li>\n 	<li>Use short and simple sentences when communicating with them.</li>\n 	<li>Speak clearly and in a normal tone of voice. Do not shout.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Individuals with mobility impairments:</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>If possible, put yourself at the person’s eye level.</li>\n 	<li>Never patronise people who uses wheelchairs by patting them on the head or shoulder.</li>\n 	<li>Do not assume the individual wants to be pushed. Always ask first.</li>\n 	<li>Offer assistance only if the individual appears to have some difficulty.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Individuals with speech impairments:</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>If you do not understand what the other person is saying, do not pretend to understand what was said. Ask them to repeat what has been said and then repeat it back to them.</li>\n 	<li>Do not speak for the individual or attempt to finish the person’s sentences.</li>\n 	<li>Ask questions that only requires short and simple sentences as answers.</li>\n 	<li>Be patient.

They may not look like it but these children often feel very vulnerable. They experience a lot of fear and distress over their learning difficulty. Some of them may cope well but others may have a hard time coping with it. Sometimes, when they act up and misbehave, we misunderstand it as a behavioural or attitude problem. What we may not understand is that all of these so-called ‘behavioural or attitude problems’ are often triggered by their anxiety.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnxiety is not something that you can easily notice.  Sometimes, you may not even have the slightest idea that your child is suffering from it. In order to understand and give proper guidance about their condition, it is important to look at the root cause of their anxiety.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn a study by Linda Houston et al, she and her colleagues examined children with learning difficulties who suffer from anxiety and they managed to identify some of the signs to watch for in order to identify whether a child with learning difficulties is suffering from anxiety (Houston, Lecours, Landry, &amp; Émond, 2016):\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Struggles in planning and performing tasks</li>\n 	<li>Constantly seeking for assurance</li>\n 	<li>Keeps fidgeting in their seat</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in focusing, concentrating or remembering</li>\n 	<li>Makes excuses and tries to avoid doing unfamiliar tasks</li>\n 	<li>Easily destabilized by a change in routine or schedule</li>\n 	<li>Hesitant to step outside of established routines</li>\n 	<li>Physical signs of discomfort (perspiring, trembling, palpitations)</li>\n 	<li>Not showing signs of listening to the answers to their questions</li>\n 	<li>Extreme perfectionism in their task</li>\n 	<li>Somatic complaints (health-related excuses)</li>\n 	<li>Asking the same questions repeatedly</li>\n 	<li>Rigidity (resistance to change)</li>\n</ul>\n<em> </em>\n\n<em>In order to help them cope with anxiety, here are some things that Debbie Hopper suggests that you can consider</em> (Hopper, 2018)<em>:</em>\n\n<em> </em>\n<ul>\n 	<li><em><strong>Environment</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<em>Creating</em> a sensory safe space for people with anxiety can help them loosen up as it allows them to be able to retreat to a safe physical space when they need a bit of time out. A sensory safe space can be anywhere at home. You can create a tent, a little nook or space in the bedroom or playroom where your child feels safe and comfortable.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><em><strong>People</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<em>Children with learning difficulties who are suffering from anxiety need people whom they can trust. Their anxiety may cause them to struggle in making friends or getting along with other children. That is why they need to be surrounded by people whom they feel safe with. An adequate support system is very important in order to provide the love and comfort that they need. </em>\n\n<em> </em>\n<ul>\n 	<li><em><strong>Sensory toys and familiar objects</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<em>Some children have a precious toy that they always carry around. </em>These toys are able to help the child to ‘zone out’ of a stressful situation by focusing on the toy instead of the situation. These ‘comfort’ toys are very helpful in calming and making them less anxious.\n\n<em> </em>\n\n<em> </em>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Weighted blankets</strong></li>\n</ul>\nOne of the most comforting things to do when your child is being anxious is to give them a hug. An alternative to that is a weighted blanket that also gives them a feeling of a ‘deep’ hug. The added bonus of using a weighted blanket is that the child is able to receive a deep hug without the direct involvement of a person. This means that the child does not have to give up their personal space in order to receive a hug.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Teaching kids about feelings</strong></li>\n</ul>\nLastly, explain to them what emotions are and how to manage them. Teaching them how to cope with their feelings is good for their emotional well-being. Make them understand that their feelings are valid and give them assurance and support to help reduce their anxiety.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nHopper, D.

During this stage, a single-celled zygote slowly develops into a fetus. It is also at the stage that vital parts of the body develop.\n\nThis stage of development is very critical. Development during the prenatal stage is the foundation of the quality of life they will have. Should the mother encounter any complications during this stage, the child’s future and development will be greatly affected. Birth defects and life-long disabilities can develop as a result of such complications.\n\nHowever, certain birth defects and life-long disabilities can be prevented. Various studies have listed several ways to prevent such birth defect and life-long disabilities.\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Get enough nutrition</strong></li>\n</ol>\nMaternal malnutrition is one of the factors that causes developmental delays and disabilities in the child.\n\nIodine, along with other minerals such as calcium and iron are important for the fetus’s development. A lack in iodine can result in profound mental retardation and several brain impairments in the child.\n\nFolic acid is another important vitamin that is needed for the fetus’s development. This vitamin is vital to the growth of the fetus’s spinal cord and brain.  A lack of this vitamin during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects known as neural tube defects.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong>Reduce stress levels during pregnancy</strong></li>\n</ol>\nFeeling stressed during the pregnancy is common. However, some studies have shown that severe emotional stress during pregnancy can lead to diabetes, hypertension and metabolic disorders in the child. Studies have also shown that severe emotional stress is linked to the development of attention deficits, cognitive performance deficits, anxiety, depression, autism and schizophrenia.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong>Lead a healthy lifestyle</strong></li>\n</ol>\nWomen who are obese before and during their pregnancy are at a higher risk for complication during pregnancy. They are at risk for spontaneous abortions and stillbirth. Children are also at a greater risk of childhood obesity and diabetes.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong>Avoid certain environmental factors</strong></li>\n</ol>\nEnvironmental factors such as exposure to lead and mercury often result in congenital anomalies, an increased risk for spontaneous abortions and stillbirth.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong>Consult the doctor before taking any medication</strong></li>\n</ol>\nCertain medications can cause serious birth defects in the fetus if it is taken during pregnancy. As such, always consult the doctor before taking any form of medication. This also includes over-the-counter medications and dietary or herbal products.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li><strong>Avoid drinking alcohol at all</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAll types of alcohol, including wine and beer, is extremely harmful to the fetus during pregnancy. It can cause spontaneous abortions, stillbirth and a range of life-long physical, behavioural and intellectual disabilities.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li><strong>Avoid smoking cigarettes</strong></li>\n</ol>\nSmoking during pregnancy greatly increase the chances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as well as the chances of a low birth weight and birth defects in the fetus. The nicotine present in cigarettes restricts the blood flow into the fetus’s brain and can damage the developing fetus’s brain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs parents, you only want the best for your child and to provide them with the best opportunities possible for the future. As such, the hard work starts from the moment you have decided to get pregnant. Though you have to be extra cautious during the 9 months of pregnancy, being able to provide a bright future for your child will be worth all the extra effort placed.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that genetics play a substantial role in your child’s development as well. As much as you do your best to control for all external factors, if there is a chromosomal mismatch between the parents’ genes or a history of disabilites, then the occurrence of disabilities is, unfortunately, unavoidable.\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nRaise Smart Kid.

Dyscalculia is a condition where a person struggles in understanding and performing math problems, or any tasks related to mathematics. Most children may have trouble in mathematics at some point especially during their first few years in school, but this is normal and they do eventually overcome it. However, in the case of children with dyscalculia, they may struggle a lot more and it perpetuates over time.\n\nChildren with dyscalculia struggles in understanding mathematical concepts such as more or less and bigger or smaller. They also lack number sense which is understanding the connection of the word form and numeric form of numbers. Children with dyscalculia also struggles in performing or solving mathematical equations. Additionally, they may struggle in counting, telling time and understanding math symbols.\n\nDyscalculia is also referred to as a mathematical learning disability or mathematical disorder. Some even call it math dyslexia. However, calling it math dyslexia can be misleading.  Dyslexia and dyscalculia may have some similarities, but they are not the same thing. Dyslexia is a reading disorder while dyscalculia is a mathematical disorder.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Symptoms of Dyscalculia</strong>\n\nSymptoms of dyscalculia varies greatly among children of different ages. Experiencing Math problems at a young age is quite common among children which makes it difficult to detect dyscalculia. However, symptoms of dyscalculia become more apparent as the child grow older. Here are some of the symptoms of dyscalculia to look out for in your child:\n\n<strong>Pre-school</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Trouble in the order of numbers when counting. Forgets and skips numbers more frequently than other children</li>\n 	<li>Struggles in connecting numeric symbol to its word from. For example, the child may not understand that number “1” is the same as “one”</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in understanding concepts like smallest or largest and tallest to shortest</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Lower Primary </strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Poor at identifying and using Math symbols like + and – properly</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in completing mental sums and may still use fingers when counting or solving simple math equations</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in understanding the concept of greater than and less than</li>\n 	<li>Struggles in identifying the place value of a number and often writes the numbers in the wrong order</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Upper Primary - Secondary School</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Takes too much time in understanding and solving Math problems</li>\n 	<li>May have a hard time dealing with money due to difficulty in computing total cost of things and change</li>\n 	<li>Actively avoid situations or games that may involve Math</li>\n 	<li>Difficulty in understanding information on charts and graphs</li>\n 	<li>Struggles in activities that are related to speed, distance and direction</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Possible Causes of Dyscalculia</strong>\n\nWhile there are no exact causes of dyscalculia, researchers identified some possible factors related to it. Firstly, dyscalculia may run in families. Genetics plays a big role in whether the child may or may not have dyscalculia. Secondly, dyscalculia can be caused by an under-development in the brain areas that are associated with numerical and mathematical processing. Thirdly, prenatal conditions have shown to affect the baby’s growth as well. For example, dyscalculia has been linked to fetal alcohol syndrome, premature birth and low birth weight. Lastly, dyscalculia can also be caused by injuries to areas of the brain that are responsible for mathematical processing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Treatment</strong>\n\nUnlike dyslexia, there are no specific teaching program for children with dyscalculia. However, professionals can provide strategies and a systematic approach to help kids learn and understand Math. There are no specified medications to treat dyscalculia.  If your child is diagnosed with dyscalculia and you want to understand the condition better, seek help to from special education teachers, Math tutors (who are experienced in working with children with learning difficulties), educational therapists, child psychologists and pediatric neuropsychologists.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nLearning Disabilities Association of America.

(3524, 1, '2019-05-10 01:23:34', '2019-05-10 01:23:34', 'Many parents, individuals and organizations advocate for the welfare and rights of children with disabilities. The role of these people is very important because they support and promote causes that will provide a quality life for children with disabilities. However, as much as these advocates are important and helpful, it is also necessary to teach children with disabilities to be an effective self-advocate.\n\n<strong>What is self-advocacy? </strong>\n\nSelf- advocacy is speaking up for yourself. According to Jenniffer Yoffie in <em>Teaching Advocacy Skills to Children with Disabilities, </em>“Self-Advocacy is empowering individuals with special needs to stand up for themselves and what they want in their life.” It is the ability of oneself to protect their rights and be able to communicate their condition and whatever they need in order to succeed in life. It means that although they may occasionally call upon the help of others, they are able to decide who and what helps them and where do the help comes from.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/about/authors/Andrew-M-I-Lee\">Andrew M.I. Lee, J.D.</a>, in <em>The Importance of Self-Advocacy for Kids with Attention and Learning Issues </em>presented three key factors in helping to further understand the concept of self-advocacy: <strong>understanding, knowing</strong> and <strong>communicating.</strong>\n\nThe first factor of self-advocacy is <em>understanding</em>, or in other words, self-awareness. This means letting the child understand their condition, strengths, weaknesses and needs. The second factor is knowing, or the ability of the child to identify the support they need from other people. Lastly, <em>communicating </em>refers to the ability of the child to convey all these things to other people for support.\n\nThe last element might be the hardest and the most important one because self-advocacy is all about speaking up. For self-advocacy to be effective, the child has to learn to understand their condition and to be able to effectively communicate their needs and wants to other people.\n\n<strong>What is the importance of self-advocacy?</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>It helps the child to perform better in school. When the child learns how to express their difficulties to the teacher, they are able to request for additional support that they need to catch up in class</li>\n 	<li>Being a self-advocate can build up their confidence and self-esteem</li>\n 	<li>It helps to develop their independence and self-empowerment</li>\n 	<li>They can learn how to overcome challenges in school on their own</li>\n 	<li>It helps them build their social skills and be able to communicate more effectively with other people</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>How to teach children to be a self-advocate?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Allow them to understand their condition</strong> – The first step is always allowing them the opportunity to understand more about the nature of their condition. Educate them about their disability so they can also explain it to other people. Explain it to them the simplest way possible. You can also help them express it to other people by teaching them what to say or record audio materials to briefly explain their condition.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong>Build their self-esteem</strong> – Children with disability usually have low self-esteem. Help them build it up by highlighting their strengths and potential rather than their weaknesses. Talk to them constantly about things that they are good at and let them realise that they are not limited by their disabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong>Help them develop their independence </strong>– Developing their independence can help them with their confidence. Start with simple things at home such as putting and taking off their own shoes, grooming, washing up, brushing etc.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong>Teach them social cues </strong>– For them to be an effective self-advocate, they also need to learn and develop their social skills. Teach them how to read social cues such as personal space, body language, facial expression and tones. Help them also to read and understand emotions, as well as the appropriate response to each social situation.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong>Motivate them to speak up</strong> – Encourage your child to speak up. Engage them in conversation more often and talk about their worries and needs. This would help them to feel comfortable when talking about their condition. Commend them also when they speak up to encourage them.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li><strong>Role-play</strong> – Role-playing can help them practice what to actually do when they are in situations that they need to explain or protect themselves. This prepares them for different situations that they may encounter in the future. Start with school settings such as interacting with their classmates or teachers.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nTeaching self-advocacy to children is not easy. This is even more difficult for children with disabilities. It takes time and practice to develop this skill. Most children with disabilities have low self-esteem so speaking up is a big challenge for them. Sometimes, they feel embarrassed to ask for help or they are unsure of how to effectively express themselves. But one important thing to teach them is that, it is okay to ask for help. At the most, the individual will say no. But just because one person says no, it does not mean that the next person you ask will say no as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>References</h1>\nAndrew M.I. Lee, J.

But what makes it harder for them is dealing with the judgement and discrimination from other people. Thousands of people around the world suffer from one form of disability. Some of them are fortunate enough to be able to succeed despite their condition, but a lot of them are not as fortunate. They are afraid to step out of their comfort zone because of the fear of not being accepted. This brings us to the question – is our world ready to accept and integrate with people with disabilities?\n\n<strong>What is Disability Awareness?</strong>\n\nDisability awareness is being able to understand and recognize people with disabilities and their disposition. It is educating oneself about their condition, their rights, and what we could do to help them. Disability awareness is very important because it breaks the stigma and stereotypes about people with disabilities. It is a very helpful step in breaking down barriers and creating a world that is more accepting and inclusive for them.\n\n<strong>Tolerance vs. Acceptance and Inclusion</strong>\n\n<em>Tolerance</em>,<em> acceptance</em> and<em> inclusion</em> are three words that we usually encounter when talking about disability awareness. Although they may seem to be related, the concept of these terms towards disability is completely different.\n\nTolerance towards people with disabilities means you are submitting to the differences – you recognize them and you are okay with it. It is being open and understanding about their condition and respect who they are. However, acceptance and inclusion go beyond tolerance.\n\nAcceptance of people with disabilities is not just being okay with them. If tolerance recognizes the differences, acceptance disregards the differences because they accept the person as they are without judgement. It is seeing them as an equal.\n\nLastly, inclusion of people with disabilities means you take part in recognizing their rights and providing equal support and opportunities for them. It means understanding the relationship between the way they function and how they participate in society, and making sure they have the same opportunities to participate in every aspect of life to the best of their abilities and desires.\n\nPromoting disability awareness should not just stop at tolerance. We should encourage the community to be more accepting and inclusive of people with disabilities. Now, what can we do to promote disability awareness?\n\n<strong>Education</strong>\n\nThe first step in promoting disability awareness is of course, education. Educating ourselves and also other people about people with disabilities can give us a better understanding about what they are experiencing. These are some of the things you can do to educate people about disability awareness:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Organize events such as talks and seminars that promotes disability awareness</li>\n 	<li>Create an online propaganda to promote awareness. Use the internet and social media to spread awareness as they are becoming a successful tool for information dissemination.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Opportunities for People with Disabilities</strong>\n\nNot many people with disabilities are given the same opportunities in the workforce as compared to their peers. They are often discriminated because of their disabilities. Providing equal opportunities and giving them a fair chance to prove themselves is the best way to promote awareness and inclusivity.\n\n<strong>View them as Valuable Consumers</strong>\n\nMarketing plans often disregard the disabled community. We sometimes forget that they, too, have the power to purchase. Considering people with disabilities as potential consumers when marketing products allows people to be aware of them and thus, make a greater effort to include them.\n\nThese are just some of the many things we can do to help promote disability awareness.  Tolerance towards people with disability is fair and objective enough but let’s not settle with doing just that. As our world continues to grow and innovate, we should also keep on breaking down walls and stereotypes among people with disabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

(3594, 1, '2019-06-06 05:46:56', '2019-06-06 05:46:56', 'Part of parenting is managing with your child’s behaviour. Every child exhibits different and challenging behaviours, be it in the classroom or at home. However, if these behaviours are left unaddressed, they can develop into something potentially more troublesome in the future. Some examples of inappropriate behaviours are:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Disrupting classes</li>\n 	<li>Using inappropriate languages</li>\n 	<li>Being aggressive towards the teachers or classmates</li>\n 	<li>Refuse to participate in class activities</li>\n 	<li>Bullying</li>\n 	<li>Destruction of property</li>\n 	<li>Anxiety</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>What is Behavioural Intervention</strong>\n\nBehavioural Interventions are steps and strategies designed to understand and help with behavioural problems among children. There is no one-fit-all method for behavioural interventions because the steps and the types of strategies to employ varies depending on the problem and needs of the child.\n\nIn order to address behavioural problems such as the examples shown above, you must first identify the root of the problem. There is always a reason why the child is behaving inappropriately. Professionals usually do a Functional Behaviour Assessment (FBA) to find out the reason for the child’s actions. In FBA, teachers and staff interview and observe the child in order to pinpoint possible causes of misbehaviour. For instance, a child tends to be disruptive and inattentive in class because they are unable to follow along with the pace of teaching. His behaviour might be triggered by underlying learning difficulties such as dyslexia or ADHD. The result of the FBA will be the basis of the Behavioural Intervention Plan (BIP) they would develop to help the child. In this manner, the behaviour can, then, be addressed properly.\n\nBehavioural Intervention Plans are strategies designed to address a specific inappropriate behaviour. The BIP is basically a three-step process; describing the behaviour; identifying the cause of the behaviour and lastly; providing strategies to change the behaviour. It aims to modify a child’s negative behaviour by giving positive reinforcement for replacement behaviour.\n\nAfter identifying the root cause of the problem, the next step is to implement the strategies for intervention. Some of which are:\n\n<strong>Learn to identify triggers –</strong> the importance of knowing what triggers the child’s inappropriate behaviour is that you can avoid it before it actually causes a problem. For example, you are aware that your child does not like sharing toys. Before they act aggressively to their playmates, you can negotiate with them in advance on how to share toys with their playmates so everyone can play together.\n\n<strong>Redirection/Calming – </strong>when a child starts acting up and is being aggressive towards their classmates or any family member, try to calm them down by talking to them softly. Alternatively, you can also redirect his focus by giving him toys to play or play soothing music to relieve his stress.\n\n<strong>Ignoring non-serious behaviours –</strong> If you think the behaviour is not serious enough and does not cause any harm, try to ignore it. Sometimes, a child exhibit inappropriate behaviour to get attention. If they think that the behaviour would not help them to achieve their goal, they will eventually stop in engaging said behaviour. Attention-seeking behaviours often get worse before they eventually go away.\n\n<strong>Discipline in private –</strong> if you must discipline your child for their behaviour, do it in private. Do not let his classmates or siblings watch. Many children see it as a challenge when adults attempt to discipline them in front of their peers. If they are seen publicly refusing to obey a teacher, young children feel like they gain more “street cred” from their peers. A child is more likely to accept discipline if his or her peers are not watching the process.\n\n<strong>Positive Reinforcement –</strong> giving rewards and acknowledging positive behaviour is an effective way to encourage the child to show appropriate behaviours in class or at home. Giving them extra credit or simply just by praising them can help to inspire them to do good and to be good. Reinforcers can be tangible such as toys and awards, but it can also be activities. For example, you can say that if they pay attention in class, they can play playdoh or any games that they want after class. Activity reinforcers are actually the most effective as they allow the child to participate in their preferred activities with other students. This way, it also builds in social reinforcement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImplementing behavioural interventions are usually done by professionals in a classroom setting. However, it is also important to involve parents in the behavioural intervention process because they know the child better than anyone else. They are a great help in identifying the history or causes of the behaviour since they are with them at home. The collaboration of parents and professionals is essential and vital in behavioural intervention. The professional can understand the child’s nature of behaviour more by knowing the family. The family can also learn how to participate more in the intervention by learning about the approach from the professional. This way, both can design and implement an appropriate behavioural intervention plan for the child.\n\nBehavioural intervention plans vary with each child. It may not work immediately but it will gradually take effect. Managing a child’s behaviour is challenging but you should always be patient and stay calm. Moreover, be consistent.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nPACER Center. (2014). <em>PACER Center.</em> Retrieved from pacer.org: https://www.pacer.org/parent/php/php-c215b.pdf\n\nPark, J.

(3664, 1, '2019-07-10 02:19:40', '2019-07-10 02:19:40', 'As human beings, there are things and circumstances around us that will affect us emotionally, be it seeing a child crying or seeing a little puppy whining for attention. In situations of great distress, we may be prone to exhibiting unsightly behaviours and making rash decisions. In order to avoid such scenarios from happening, we exert a great amount of control over our emotions by using various adaptive strategies. This skill is called emotional regulation.\nHowever, unlike most people, children with special needs struggle greatly with emotional regulation. They have difficulty in developing adaptive skills to manage their emotions. Children with ADHD, for example, tend to show excessive emotions and when they do, they are perceived to be overly loud or overly emotional, resulting in their peers rejecting them and causing these children to become social outcasts and to experience emotional distress.\n\nAnother group of children with special needs who have trouble with emotional regulation are those with ED or Emotional Difficulty. Children with ED are either too emotional or not emotional at all. They may either exhibit externalizing behaviours in the form of aggression and non-compliance, or they may internalize their feelings and show zero emotions. As such, these children have trouble creating relationships with other people because they are often misunderstood when they show their emotions in a different manner, intensity or even timing.\n\nIt is therefore crucial to develop the ability to regulate your emotions as early as possible. If delayed or neglected, it could lead to much bigger problems for the child in the future. Younger children are unable to fully comprehend their emotions just yet. They require proper guidance from parents and teachers to help them understand and manage their emotions. In relation to this, studies have suggested that picture books play an important role in helping children manage their emotional difficulties.\n\nPicture Books\nAs the word itself implies, picture books are children books that contain various illustrations describing an event or a story. Picture books are very appealing to children because of the colourful illustrations inside. Not everyone may know this but aside from the entertainment it provides for children, picture books have important benefits to their emotional well-being.\n\nChildren are usually fond of the characters in picture books because they are relatable. The children can relate to the feelings and emotions of the characters to themselves. They are able to understand their own feelings because they see it being portrayed by the characters. When they see a picture of a sad kid because of a broken toy, they realise that that was the feeling they felt when their toy broke. They will be able to identify with feeling of ‘sadness’ that is being portrayed and it validates how they felt and reacted when they were in the same scenario. As such, the child is then able to talk more openly about their feelings and discuss their feelings in a more constructive way.\n\nPicture books also help children in literacy development. They learn about different cultures, emotions, events, etc. through the narratives of the picture book. It widens their vocabulary and helps enhance their comprehension skills as well.\n\nAnother way a child learn about emotions is through the signs and images they get from other people. This type of learning is called visual literacy. Unfortunately, children with special needs struggle with this aspect. They have difficulty decoding signs and symbols to identify emotions. As such, using illustrations to represent emotions can help them to develop their visual literacy. Picture books serve as a more tangible representation of emotions and body language through the characters in the story. It is also easier for children to recall this information since picture books are more accessible.\n\nTeaching emotional regulation to children with special needs can be very difficult. However, with the appropriate and structured strategies and, of course, with the help of picture books, it is not impossible. It starts from making them understand their own emotions so they can learn to regulate it. Although it will take a lot of hard work and patience, it will surely be worth it as the child’s overall well-being, such as their emotional, mental and physical health, is utmost important.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBibliography\nZambo, D.

(3673, 1, '2019-08-14 04:55:38', '2019-08-14 04:55:38', 'Teaching can be very challenging at times, especially in a classroom setting. There are so many possible distractions and the classroom can be very chaotic. It is already difficult enough to hold a great number of students in one room, but it becomes even more difficult when one or some of them have challenging behaviours.\n\nIn a classroom, there are many different kinds of students. More often than not, there will be some students who are a challenge to work with. They tend to be the ones who cause distractions in class. This kind of situations often compromises the quality of learning for the other students. There is no one-method-fix-all solution when working with these children. As such, to help you with that, here are some strategies on how to work with them:\n\n<strong>Pay Attention To Triggers</strong>\n\nChildren starts displaying difficult behaviour when they are triggered by certain events. One very helpful way to manage such situations is to identify what are the possible triggers. By doing so, you are able to pre-empt when a tantrum might happen and take pre-emptive measures to prevent it from happening. For example, whenever a student gets hungry, he will become sulky and starts distracting the class. What you can do is schedule frequent breaks in between lessons. These breaks are also useful for the other students as well as it gives them a break from studying and gives them a chance to refresh their brains by walking around.\n\n<strong>Understand Their Level Of Capability</strong>\n\nBeing aware of the child’s level of capability very important as it might be the reason why a child is misbehaving in class. There are times when a child might throw a tantrum as they are unable to understand the instructions that are being given due to the complexity of the task or the words being used. Knowing the extent of their skills and capability is important to avoid any form of misunderstanding between you and your perceived knowledge of the child’s behaviour. This could also help you to come up with various solutions like engaging a private tutor or requesting additional aid from the school to help them keep up with their school work.\n\n<strong>Learn About The Student’s Background</strong>\n\nPossessing an in-depth knowledge of the student’s learning journey is also beneficial. Ask about their performance from previous teachers, learn more about their family, their relationships at home, what kind of rewards are they partial to, and even what kind of consequences are they aware of. This comes in handy when working with the student in class.  You gain a better understanding of how to work with them, what possible difficulties they might encounter and what are the appropriate solutions that can be taken.\n\n<strong>Observe Their Style Of Learning</strong>\n\nEach student has a different style of learning. Some prefer reading words while others prefer drawing diagrams and mind maps to deepen their understanding of a concept. As mentioned before, there is no one-method-fix-all solution. Not all teaching methods are suitable for every student in class. As such,  they start to lose interest as they are unable to follow along with the class. One way around it is to employ various learning styles in your lessons so you are able to engage every student in class.\n\n<strong>Build A Relationship With Them</strong>\n\nBuild a relationship with them so that they become more comfortable with you. This could help them to be more open and cooperative in class. Students with challenging behaviours are often misunderstood, neglected and perceived as annoying by their peers and therefore, are often loners in class. However, these children need only require a little more patience and love from those around them. If you have a comfortable relationship with them, they will be more open and receptive when you teach them different methods to help them manage their behaviours. It will be difficult and trying at times but the benefits will be worth it.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nCrowe, C. (2010). Teaching Children with Challenging Behavior.

He is well known for his roles in the movie series “<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>” and “<em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>”. He had starred alongside famous artists like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt.</h4>\nBloom had been into arts even at an early age. He attended drama school and joined theater organizations. He partakes in different plays and stage performances which eventually lead him to Hollywood.\n\nBehind his success in his acting career, Orlando Bloom also have a fair share of struggles growing up. When he was seven, he was diagnosed with dyslexia.  In a video interview by <em>Made By Dyslexia</em>, Bloom shared how he suffered growing up with the condition. He admits how school was not easy for him. He sometimes gets so angry and frustrated with himself because he feels stupid. He struggles a lot in spelling and writing. In a separate video by <em>Freedom of Speech Ltd</em>, Bloom was asked how he handles homework during his school days, and he said it was a nightmare. “Homework was always hard for me, writing essays, dissertation. As I say, getting my thoughts on a page, it was so difficult.” he added.\n\nBloom also recalls the struggles he faced during performances because of his condition. He would have stage fright and it will take a lot of hard work and extra time for him to practice his lines.  As a child, Bloom also experienced being labelled with dyslexia, but he used that as a motivation to work harder and overcome it. He found acting as an outlet for his imaginations. Now if asked what he would tell his 7-year-old self, it would be “Hold on to your dreams and never ever think that you’re not good enough or that you’re stupid. Never let anyone tell you that you’re stupid or you’re not capable… We are equal, we deserve a shot.”\n\nNow, Orlando Bloom speaks openly about his experiences and struggles with having dyslexia. He motivates children with dyslexia to take this obstacle as a chance to grow better and to win in life. Finally, he believes that finding the right way to educate children with dyslexia is important to help them develop their love for learning. “If education is a challenge for a child with dyslexia, you need to understand how to educate them so that it isn\'t a challenge, so that it\'s fun, because it\'s not that they\'re stupid, it\'s not that they\'re not capable, they just need to learn how to enjoy the process of learning.”\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\nBloom, O.

School was not easy for Goldberg. She suffered difficulties in learning and eventually dropped out of high school when she was 17. She was not diagnosed of dyslexia until she entered adulthood that is why she lived with all the judgement for years. She was subjected to bullying because everyone thought she was just lazy and stupid for failing school. “When I was a kid, they didn\'t call it dyslexia. They called it... being slow, or you were retarded...\" Goldberg recalls during an interview for Child Mind. After dropping out from school, due to her anxieties and low self-esteem, Goldberg was exposed to drugs.\n\nAmidst all the challenges she encountered, Whoopi knew that she was more than what other people describe her to be. She knew that she was not stupid or dumb because she has a great memory. As she said, “If you read to me, I could tell you everything you read.” She is good in memorizing scripts and she always wanted to become an actor. She is creative and talented but the only problem she had was her reading. If there is one good thing that Whoopi could remember during those tough years is having a very supportive mother who understands her very well. Her mother knew that she has a special way of learning. When she dropped out at school, her mother would give her money so she could go to museums and sit in lectures to learn.\n\nWhoopi made a name for herself in the entertainment industry and starred in different shows and plays. She became very successful in her craft and became one of the 14 entertainers to win a Grammy, Oscar, Emmy and Tony Award. She is now a host of her own talk show The View.\nWhen asked about how her condition affected her as a person, Whoopi said it made her be introspective. “Made me more thoughtful, maybe slightly slower in how I do things because it takes me a minute sometimes to figure things out.” Whoopi learned to embrace and live with her condition and use it to succeed in her craft. She was once quoted saying, “Normal is nothing more than a cycle on a washing machine.” as it is okay to be not normal; that there is more to life even if you are not like the others.\n\nWhoopi also shared how the role of parents and teachers are important in the journey of children with dyslexia. She is encouraging parents to be supportive of their children because as what she said, “You’re all we have”. It is important for children to know that there is someone who believes and understands them. She also shared how teachers helped and inspired her. “Teachers have always been, to me, the brightest lights in the neighbourhood. Without them, the world is so much smaller for kids.”\n\nWhoopi is now an advocate for people with dyslexia and other learning difficulties. Along with other celebrities like Steven Spielberg, Anderson Cooper, Keira Knightley, Sir Richard Branson, and John Chambers who also suffer from learning difficulties, Whoopi became active in supporting and promoting campaigns that help students with dyslexia succeed in school.\n\nBibliography\nEhmke, R.

From the vast amount of online resources available, we may be able to form some idea as to how dyslexia affects a person but, do really know what it is like to be in their shoes or even fully comprehend how this difficulty affects their daily lives and what kind of struggles they face? In this article, I will try to explain what it is like to be dyslexic.\n\nFirstly, you must understand what graphemes and phonemes are. Graphemes are the smallest unit of understanding in written form (how the letter is written) and phonemes are the distinct sound of a single unit in the alphabet (how it sounds). When we read, we attach the proper phoneme to its corresponding grapheme. For example, we know that the letter “A” makes an “ah” sound. However, for people with dyslexia, the grapheme-phoneme principle is not well-formed in their brain’s processing areas. They struggle to match phonemes and its corresponding grapheme as they cannot recognise the individual alphabets. They have difficulty processing that the letter “A” makes an “ah” sound because the letter “A” simply does not make sense and it merely looks like strokes of lines and shapes overlapping each other.\n\nSecondly, aside from having difficulty in recognising alphabets, people with dyslexia also see words and letters differently when reading. Unimaginable as it may seem, in the eyes of people with dyslexia, letters are dancing as if they have lives of their own. They move sideways, up and down; they flip, juggle and disappear individually or sometimes all at once. Some even describe it like little insects running around.  People with dyslexia also often mix up the letters in words when reading. For example, they read “day” as “bay”, “queen” as “pueen” or “left” as “felt”. They often mix up letters that look alike such as “p” and “q” or “b” and “d”, and even words that are spelt in similar ways such as “book” and “cook”, “chips” and “ships” or “male” and “lame”.\n\nTo further understand this idea, the illustration below shows how reading is like in the eyes of people with dyslexia:\n\n(**double click image to play)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/07-dyslexia-gif-victor-weidell.nocrop.w710.h2147483647-1.gif\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3711 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/07-dyslexia-gif-victor-weidell.nocrop.w710.h2147483647-1-300x240.gif\" alt=\"dyslexia\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a>\n\nAs a result of their difficulty with reading, people with dyslexia also tend to have problems with writing. They write as they read, so letters are usually not in place and are mixed up. Their handwriting is often cluttered and messy.\n\nDyslexia is incurable and is a lifelong condition. However, people with dyslexia can learn different techniques on how to manage and overcome it. Some people who were able to overcome dyslexia rely heavily on their memory. They memorise how words and alphabets look like and their corresponding sounds, so they are able to recognise it when they come across it in the future. This process, however, is tedious because it requires a lot of effort and patience.\n\nNow that we understand what people with dyslexia are going through, we should try to be more patient and understanding towards them. Do not mock the way they read because they will get embarrassed and be discouraged towards reading. Pay attention to them when they read. Lastly, be patient no matter how slow they are in reading and writing because they are also trying their best.\n\n&nbsp;', 'What it is like to be dyslexic?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-it-is-like-to-be-dyslexic', '', '', '2019-09-19 04:34:38', '2019-09-19 04:34:38', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3709', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This unusual development affects the person\'s attention span and self-control. Symptoms vary and affects each individual differently, making it hard to detect. As a result, many are unaware that they have ADHD until they have reached adulthood. While there is no formal statistics done in Singapore, a survey conducted in the US on the number of children with diagnosed ADHD shows that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html\">ADHD is a lot more common than you think</a>.\n\nADHD affects a person\'s attention span and self-control. People with this condition are usually hyperactive, sensitive, unable to focus and easily distracted. Often times, these symptoms are misunderstood as a personality or an attitude problem.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for people with ADHD to explain their condition to other people as they struggle to figure out what is happening inside their heads. Furthermore, most people just assume that you are not trying hard enough rather than allude it to an actual problem with the brain. Books may tell us this and that, but they do not give us a full understanding of what people with this condition is going through.\n\nHaving ADHD is like having an extremely active, but unproductive mind. It is akin to disorganised bees constantly buzzing around inside your head, except these bees are disorganised and are not given focused tasks. It feels like a computer that keeps on crashing - various applications are being opened, your web browser has 1000 tabs opened on 1000 different topics, causing your computer to lag and crash constantly. You try to close some of them but nothing is responding! It is like a massive traffic jam on the highway with all the non-stop honking and shouting. Having ADHD means that your head is in constant chaos with no respite nor rest at any given moment, no matter how hard you try.\n\nWith all the chaos going on inside their head, people with ADHD tend to space out. The multitude of information that they need to process inside their brain makes them distracted and preoccupied. You can often observe them staring into space and become unresponsive to the people around them which is why they are often being tagged as slow or rude when they require multiple attempts in order to catch their attention.\n\nAs there are a lot of things going on in their heads, people with ADHD also tend to be more hyperactive and unfocused. Their attention shift from one thing to another rapidly. This often gets them into trouble particularly at work and school because it may result in unfinished tasks. This is also why they are often being misunderstood as lazy, unproductive and unorganised.\n\nIt is difficult to understand what it is like to have ADHD but believe me, these people are trying their very best. We may not see it, but they struggle in their own way and do put in their best efforts. They are often frustrated with themselves when they cannot seem to control their thoughts, their words and their actions. They may come off as arrogant and rude but understand that they are not actually like that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/programs-2/\">Find out</a> how we can help your child with special needs learn better.</em>\n\n<em><a href=\"http://cognitive.com.sg/contact-us/\">Connect with us</a> for enquiries about academic support for children with special needs.</em>', 'What is it like to have ADHD?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'adhd-feels-like', '', '', '2019-10-02 23:14:29', '2019-10-02 23:14:29', '', 0, 'http://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3719', 0, 'post', '', 0),

These are the songs our parents usually play or sing to us to entertain us. Before we learned about bands and pop songs, nursery rhymes were our jam. Nursery rhymes are traditional poems and songs for children. They usually tell short stories of animals and people using repetitive lines and rhyming words. They have simple and repetitive melodies that are easy for children to follow.\n\nHowever, do you know that nursery rhymes are actually more than just a means of entertainment for the kids? They play an important role in a child’s development as well! Here is how nursery rhymes benefit your children:\n\n<strong>Speech Development</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes helps in the child’s speech development. By listening to the song, the children learn to recognize words and music. They begin to imitate repetitive words they hear from the song. The more they listen to it, the more they remember it until they can finally enunciate the words properly.\n\n<strong>Cognitive Development</strong>\n\nRepetition in nursery rhymes is very useful in developing a child’s brain. It improves their memory skills and comprehension through new words that they encounter. It also develops their thinking skills.\n\n<strong>Reading Comprehension</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes can help children improve their reading comprehension because a nursery rhyme is essentially a short story. This is where children first understand the sequencing concept of simple stories which has a beginning, a middle and an end. It also develops their understanding through the different concepts and social setting in the story.\n\n<strong>Language Proficiency</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes also develop children’s vocabulary. It is where they first encounter words and meanings. They learn to understand the meaning of words and interpret words based on the context of the story. Songs are also a good way to help improve a child’s spelling ability as children find it easier to follow along with the catchy tune and lyrics.\n\n<strong>Physical Development</strong>\n\nSome nursery rhymes involve actions and little dance steps that children usually follow. This would make them move which helps improve their overall coordination and enhances their gross motor skills. It can also be a form of exercise for them.\n\n<strong>Social and Communication Skills</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes involves social situations which children can learn from. It teaches making friends and communicating with other people. Nursery rhymes can also be used in group activities which provides an avenue for the children to meet other people.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>Enhances Creativity</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes allow children to imagine scenarios in their head. This enhances their imagination and develops their creativity when engaging in pretend play activities.\n\n<strong>Mathematics</strong>\n\nNursery rhymes helps in developing the mathematical ability of children. The songs usually involve the concept of sizes and shapes. Some songs even teach children how to count and spell numbers!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSimple things such as singing and dancing along to these nursery rhymes can be both educational and fun for your child. Not only do they get to learn from these songs, you get the opportunity to bond with your child too. Nursery rhymes are more than just simple songs.

(3779, 1, '2019-12-12 02:28:47', '2019-12-12 02:28:47', 'The streaming system of Singapore’s secondary education has brought about a lot of concerns from parents. This streaming system, in a way, has created a stereotype regarding the students who are in each respective stream. More often than not, the Normal (Technical) stream tends to have a reputation of having rebellious students and a place where students will learn to join gangs and engage in socially unacceptable behaviour. As such, if parents discover that their child is at risk of entering the Normal (Technical) stream, they panic and start signing up their child for various tuition programmes, in hopes of raising their grades so their child can avoid entering the Normal (Technical) stream.\n\nHowever, if you look at it from a different perspective, being in the Normal (Technical) stream is not a disadvantage. It can, instead, be an advantage to your child and help them to be more successful in life. Being in the Normal (Technical) stream where the pacing of lessons is not as competitive, the student has more time to explore their potentials and eventually discover their talents.\n\n<strong>Opportunity to expand their network</strong>\n\nAfter their N’ Level exams, students in the N(T) stream will enter ITE for their Nitec certificate. The way ITE is structured is such that they place more emphasis on workplace and hands-on training over academic excellence. They will then obtain greater exposure to their chosen field of study and gain more experience as compared to their peers in the other streams. This also gives them the opportunity to meet other professionals in the industry they are in and expand their network. Having the right network and knowing the right people can help them to land their dream job in the future. It can also be their edge over students from different streams. As they say in the workforce nowadays, “It is not what you know but whom you know”.  Their working experience from ITE and the connections they made can then be their ticket to a successful future.\n\n<strong>Opportunity to explore self-identity</strong>\n\nStudents in the Express and Normal (Academic) stream often face more pressure than their peers in the Normal (Technical) stream as the environment is much more competitive and focused on academic excellence. As such, in the midst of our competitive pursuits for academic excellence, we do not question our goals and motivations and consider what we really want in life. This causes a big problem when we enter our second phase of life where we have to decide on which career pathway we want to embark on.\n\nOn the other hand, students in the Normal (Technical) stream have a much more gentler learning curve. The syllabus is less competitive and academic focused. More emphasis is placed on providing trainings, workshops and courses that helps to develop their skills and to discover their interests. Through this, they get more freedom to explore their talents and discover their self-identity. They get to experience different paths through workshops and camps and eventually learn what they are good at. They get to discover their strengths and weaknesses and find their niche. They get to better understand themselves by helping them to realize their goals in life and giving them a strong sense of direction towards what they are working for.\n\n<strong>Develops courage and character</strong>\n\nEven though the pacing in the Normal (Technical) stream is much gentler than, students still face hardships in their learning especially those who have learning difficulties such as dyslexia. They need to work much harder than other students in order to keep up with the pace of learning. Through this journey of hard work, they are then more likely to develop the strength to overcome adversities and learn to never give up as they never had things easy and they needed to work harder in order to be on par with their peers from the other streams. These positive traits will take them far in the future.\n\n<strong>It’s not too late for degrees and universities</strong>\n\nThe most common concern from parents with children who goes to the Normal (Technical) stream is that their children might not be able to go to a university and get a degree. Fear not because nowadays, ITEs are now preparing their students to enter university. The route to a university degree will be much longer as they will have to take the Normal (Technical) -&gt; ITE -&gt; Polytechnic -&gt; University route but in the grand scheme of things, it is just a few more years. If taking this route allows your child to be better prepared for the next 40 years of working life, I would say it is worth it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStudents who are in N(T) may often feel like they’re being left out of their peers who got to N(A). Even some parents may even get disappointed when their child take the N(T) route. This usually causes the students to slack of even more and lose their motivation to study. However, we shouldn’t see things that way. Going to N(T) isn’t the end of everything. If you see N(T) as a disadvantage, then it might just turn out bad. But, if you see things in a different perspective, N(T) might be just what your child needs.\n\nTake N(T) as new opportunity for your children to learn what’s best for them rather than a disadvantage. Things might just be a little bit slower in N(T) compared to other streams but remember that diamonds aren’t made overnight. N(T) helps you children explore their potentials. It gives them a taste of real-life hustle which helps in building their character. It teaches them to be courageous and able to withstand and overcome difficulties. These are important values that would take them far in the future.', 'Looking at the Normal (Technical) Stream from a Different Perspective', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'looking-at-the-normal-technical-stream-from-a-different-perspective', '', '', '2019-12-12 02:28:47', '2019-12-12 02:28:47', '', 0, 'https://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3779', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(3797, 1, '2020-01-30 08:15:40', '2020-01-30 08:15:40', 'The foundation of education starts not at school, but rather at home. Family, especially parents, are the role models from which children would derive their core values, inspiration and motivation. As such, parents play a vital role in shaping the outlook of a child’s academic journey. Practices at home can have a vital influence on the child’s learning habits, how they handle their failures and successes, which would have a massive impact on their academic achievements.\n\nIf you’re thinking of boosting your child’s performance in school without depending solely on their basic class activities, here are some suggestions to help maximise the support your child receives:\n\nWhile you may not necessarily have the tools or understanding of the current educational demands in schools, there are ways in which you can still be actively involved in your child’s learning development. Every child is special and <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2016/06/learning-memory\">how they learn best is different as well</a>. By involving yourself in your child’s development, you would be able to find out how best your child learns and which tools or services out there would give your child the best chance at succeeding.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Schedule learning time at home/ homework</strong></h2>\nConsistency, discipline and routine is very important for a child\'s cognitive development. In the long run, whether to help them succeed in school or in life, these are the 3 core disciplines that would allow any child to maximise their potential. Just like reminding your child to brush their teeth at least twice a day would minimize the number of cavities in their mouths and keep their teeth healthy, giving them schedules helps to build consistency and routine.\n\n24 hours a day is very long if you do not have a plan, and more often than not, would end up being wasted away, so helping your child schedule and break down their time to bite-sizes would help them to place focus on their given tasks at each allotted time, including play.\n\nAs parents, your child would look up to you as a role model, and the best way to lead your child is by action. What goes on at home would set your child’s perception on what is normal, as such getting involved by setting a routine for yourself would go a long way to motivate your child to do the same.\n\nMoreover, you would know your child’s activities and commitment best, and would be in the best position to help your child plan his/her time and enforce this positive behavior with rewards or praises.\n\nHaving a child is an enriching journey, not only for the child itself but for you as well. Be the best you can for your child!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Assisting your child with his/her academics</strong></h2>\nFor parents who are comfortable helping with your child’s homework or tasks, assisting them with their daily homework/learning would be very helpful to strengthen your child\'s learning development.\n\nSchools, for the most part, serve to equip your child with new knowledge. However, after your child has learned something, they would have to find a way to remember them. Schools do that by assigning homework, exercises and exams to help your child review what they have learned, as well as ensure that they have learned the right thing. Unfortunately, teachers may not always have the available time or resources to review with each and every child after they have marked them. This is where you, as a parent, can step in to assist your child in keeping afloat on their academics.\n\nBe involved in your child’s homework, exams or tasks. That’s not to say that you must watch over your child as he/she works on it or keep track on all the homework, exercises or tests returned to them. Rather, it can be as simple as keeping an open communication channel by encouraging your child to approach you or contact you if they ever require assistance or clarification.\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Never berate them for a task poorly done, provide guidance to help them do better next time.</h3>\n</blockquote>\nHomework never has to be a dreading task - constantly encourage your child and remind him/her that he/she is not alone. Overtime, your child will develop self-confidence, strong self-esteem and a positive attitude towards challenges.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Provide sufficient support to help your child succeed</strong></h2>\nThese days, you would be hard-pressed to find a family where there is only 1 bread winner. Due to the cost of living and constantly evolving job market, not every couple would feel comfortable putting all their eggs into one basket. As such, the amount of time that can be spent on monitoring your child’s progress can be limited.\n\nIn such instances, you can get support from external parties in the progress of your child’s development. Whether it be hired help, tuition, enrichment classes, childcare centres these are the available services that could aid in your child\'s development.\n\nActively communicate with your child to ensure that your child is comfortable, in a conducive environment and receiving sufficient support from these services.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://cognitive.com.sg/\">our site</a> to find out more on how we can support your child.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Allow room for mistakes</strong></h2>\nMistakes does not signal an end, they are opportunities for a child to learn. Different children learn differently, and not all children are prodigies, as such, you should never hold your child to high expectations without allowing any room for mistakes and failures.\n\nPutting pressure on your child might end up being counter-productive and cause them to develop negative associations to learning especially if your child is unable to meet your expectations. Nobody is perfect but everyone has the potential to succeed. Instead, work with your child to find the best way to help them succeed.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Create a learning zone</strong></h2>\nEven as adults, we have been there. Even with the best of intentions to stay on task, we still catch ourselves watching Netflix or liking people’s Instagram photos while we are supposed to work. Given that everything is made so accessible through our phones and internet connection, distractions are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Distractions cause a massive loss of productivity as your focus is divided.\n\nTo help your child minimize the amount of distractions available, you can create a space at home where it is exclusively for your child to study. I know, space constraints are a thing and not everyone has the luxury of having a spare room to convert to a study room. That is reality. So instead of getting that fancy study room, you can instead utilize an arbitrary space in your house that has the least number of items that are distracting to your child. For some, it might be their dining table, for others, it may be in the room you share with your spouse. Perhaps shifting all the distracting elements and concentrating them elsewhere might be the way to go.\n\nIf it is impossible for you to create a space for your child, then there are other alternative spaces outside that may provide them a conducive environment, such as the library or even their school campus. However, for such scenarios, it is vital that you are aware of the tasks needed to be completed and ensure to check that it is done, otherwise this would be counterproductive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/distractions.htm\">this article</a>, some pointers may be useful in helping reduce distractions at home.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Allow your child sufficient rest and play</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>&nbsp;\n<h3>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</h3>\n<h3>- The Shining, Stephen King</h3>\n</blockquote>\n&nbsp;\n\nStress plays a major role in impeding progress. Between tackling difficult or confusing concepts and processing large volumes of new information, it can get quite overwhelming for your child. So instead of continuously cramming and working, don’t forget to allow your child to get good amounts of R&amp;R. Whether it be sports, gaming, reading, or shopping, it is important to give your child an outlet for them to unwind so that they can last another mile.\n\nThis is also a good way to reward your child for a good day of hard work. Play and relaxation is 10 times more satisfying when you work for it. Play is a good way to motivate your child to put in that extra effort, and develop positive association towards work.\n\nHowever, play should never be used a means to punish them. For example, if your child misbehaves and refuses to do homework for the day, taking away play may not be helpful towards your child in the long run. Instead, try to find out the root cause for his/her unwillingness to work, and re-evaluate your child’s schedule. On some occasions, it can genuinely your child’s cry for help due to exhaustion.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Nutrition and good Health</strong></h2>\nLast but not the least, a proper diet can affect your child’s performance in school. Providing them healthy food that could help develop their brain and improve their memory. Having a well-balanced meal also helps them to get through their day-to-day activities in school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoosting your children’s academic performance can a bit challenging at times. Points discussed above can be very helpful if you can practice it right. Know that you are not alone in your child’s development and there are a lot of useful articles, book and professionals available to help you and your child succeed. Embarking on the learning journey and your child’s development can be a very rewarding and unique experience, not just for your child but for you too.

This method links the speech therapist to the client for assessment, intervention and consultation. Tele-practice is also referred to as tele-audiology, tele-speech and even speech-teletherapy.\n\nDuring this current situation, the usage of tele-practice is unavoidable. However, as with everything else, there are pros and cons to using tele-practice.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- To be able to have therapy in the comforts of your own home will allow the child to be more comfortable due to their familiar surroundings and therefore, generate lesser stress and anxiety in them.\n- Without having to take into account travelling time and unexpected situations such as traffic jams or heavy rain, the timing of the sessions can be more flexible.\n- Parents are able to observe what is happening during the therapy session and learn the the methods/techniques that are being taught by the therapist and replicate them.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- No face-to-face interaction with the child and therapist. Face-to-face contact ensures that the child stays on track and is paying attention. Through the video screen, it is often hard to determine if the child is paying attention or not.\n- Tele-practice is not a suitable option for every child. For example, children who are just beginning their speech therapy lessons as they have not built a rapport with the therapist yet. Another example are children who are below the age of 3. They are too young to be able to sit through the tele-practice without something concrete to interact with.\n\nNo doubt tele-practice is extremely convenient and more flexible in terms of timing, if your child is unsuitable for this manner of therapy, it will only do your child more harm than good. Consult with your speech therapist before deciding on the manner of intervention in order to find out what’s the best method of intervention for the benefit of your child.', 'Tele-practice', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'tele-practice', '', '', '2020-04-24 07:21:03', '2020-04-24 07:21:03', '', 0, 'https://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3886', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Although it is often observed in children with autism, you and I probably do it all the time as well!

For example, a child who engages in stimming behaviour where he runs back and forth in a straight line continuously will have his daily life affected when he refuses to sit still for schoolwork or even a meal. A child with autism may even exhibit self-injurious stimming behaviour such as smacking their heads and scratching themselves. </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"line-height: 120%; margin: 1.0pt 0in 1.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 120%;\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"line-height: 120%; margin: 1.0pt 0in 1.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 120%;\">In therapy sessions, the therapist often works on reducing the frequency of such stimming behaviour, especially if they are self-injurious and disruptive. However, if the stimming behaviour is harmless, therapists often allow the child to engage in them as it is a way of how the child expresses their feelings and/or calms themselves down.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"line-height: 120%; margin: 1.0pt 0in 1.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 120%;\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"line-height: 120%; margin: 1.0pt 0in 1.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 120%;\">If the stimming behaviour does not affect your child’s daily living and is not self-injurious, it will be better to work around it than to eliminate it completely.

Muscle weakness is not the culprit behind this disorder but rather the poor coordination between the brain signals and the muscles around the mouth area.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA common example will be when the child is trying to say the word but cannot seem to get it out or that the child said the word once but seems unable to repeat it again. Children with CAS are often described as being very difficult to understand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is currently no cure for CAS and the child cannot outgrow it. However, children with CAS can make great progress in terms of their speech and language skills with a lot of hard work and support.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><u><b>Symptoms:</b></u></strong>\n\nNot all children with CAS exhibits the same symptoms. Your child may show some or all of the symptoms below. You should always consult your doctor and see a Speech Therapist if your child is older than 3 years and:\n<ul>\n 	<li>does not always say words the same way every time</li>\n 	<li>tends to put the stress on the wrong syllable or word</li>\n 	<li>distorts or changes sounds</li>\n 	<li>can say shorter words more clearly than longer words</li>\n</ul>\nChildren with CAS may experience other difficulties such as:\n<ul>\n 	<li>difficulty with fine motor skills</li>\n 	<li>delayed language</li>\n 	<li>problems with reading, spelling, and writing</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><u><b>Treatment:</b></u></strong>\n\nTreatment for CAS should be a prolonged and intensive one whereby the goal of treatment is to help your child say sounds, words, and sentences more clearly. Research and evidence have shown that the following exercises do benefit children with CAS:\n<ul>\n 	<li>making multiple repetitions of sound sequences, words and phrases</li>\n 	<li>using “touch” cues — g. putting their finger on their lips when saying the “p” sound as a reminder to close the lips</li>\n 	<li>using “visual” cues — g. looking into a mirror when making sounds to understand the mouth movement better</li>\n 	<li>using “listening” cues — g. practicing sounds with a recorder and then listening to hear if the sounds were made correctly</li>\n 	<li>co-production i.e. having the child say the word at the same time as you</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough CAS is a difficult condition to manage, with active and intensive commitment and involvement by the family and the adults around the child, the child can reap the maximum benefits from the therapy sessions and make significant improvements to their speech and language skills.', 'Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS)', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'childhood-apraxia-of-speech-cas', '', '', '2020-06-24 04:02:38', '2020-06-24 04:02:38', '', 0, 'https://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3959', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(3966, 1, '2020-07-22 02:28:51', '2020-07-22 02:28:51', 'Preverbal skills refer to the various ways in which we communicate without words. These skills are essential as they support language learning in children. These skills include eye contact, joint attention and concentration. Once the child has mastered the basic skills of eye contact, paying attention and concentration, other forms of preverbal skills such as imitation, gestures and learning of facial expressions can then be taught more easily.\n\nIn my experience as a Speech Language Specialist, I feel that the most important skill to be taught first is eye contact. Children must first learn how to establish and maintain eye contact before they can learn to read facial cues from those around them. Only then are they better able to pay attention to the speaker and concentrate on what they are saying.\n\nParents often question what is the best approach to teach their child to maintain eye contact. In my opinion, the most effective way to teach this is through play. Play is a fun and interactive experience for the kids and can be a useful platform for teaching preverbal skills. For example, by establishing a simple routine of taking turns during play, we can teach them to pay attention to the actions of those around them. Toys like bubbles, colourful alphabet or number mats can also be used as props to further engage them. Even in our everyday lives, we can also be intentional about engaging the child and drawing their attention to the things that can be found around us. For example, we can point to a bird and telling them “Hey look there! It is a bird! The colour of the bird is black!”  This accomplishes many things at once. It helps to train the child to focus on the object, learn how to recognise said object and pick up the vocabulary that can be used to describe it.\n\nThereafter, the next skill to focus on would be joint attention skills. Joint attention refers to the shared focus that two individuals have on an object. Learning this skill helps the child to communicate better and is essential in helping them to pick up important social skills (e.g. perspective-taking) in the future. There are many ways to help a child develop their joint attention skills. Below are a list of activities that I commonly use in my lessons:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li>Playing with bubbles — Bubbles are very useful as they help get the child’s attention. After blowing the bubbles, you can get the child’s attention by popping the bubble and saying “Pop, goes the bubble” You can also sing it or use different intonations. This makes it exciting for the child. You can also try to get the child to imitate you in popping the bubbles and build their imitation skill. To encourage this process, you can first demonstrate the action that you are doing, and verbally ask them to imitate it as well. It is also important to praise the child when they are doing well. This gives them the motivation to practise these skills in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Playing with a ball — This activity involves passing a ball with a child and encouraging them to catch and throw back the ball to you. If you find it difficult to capture their attention, you can do this activity while standing closer to the child. This makes the task easier and also allows the child to focus on you easily.  This activity is best done seated on the floor with the child facing you.</li>\n</ol>\nDuring the activity, use simple sentences, that are delivered in a loud and clear manner, to instruct the child to catch the ball. Next, you can roll the ball towards them and see how they respond to it. If they pick up the ball, you can praise them for doing so as it is a sign that they are engaged in the activity. You can also describe the ball to them, using sentences like “Wow, this ball is so round!” and “This ball is blue in colour!” This introduces the object to the child and teaches them how to describe it. If they do not pick up the ball, you can demonstrate to them how it should be done by holding their hands and doing the action. Slowly, you start to encourage the child to either roll or throw the ball back to you. This activity also has the added benefit of working on their gross motor skills as well as hand-eye coordination.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoth the preverbal and joint attention skills can be imparted rather easily, as long as we are intentional about it. After all, these activities can be integrated into our everyday lives, especially during outings or during our play time with them. Helping the child to develop both these skills puts them in good stead to pick up important social skills in future, which would allow them to interact and communicate better with others in future.', 'Preverbal and Joint Attention Skills', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'preverbal-and-joint-attention-skills', '', '', '2020-07-22 02:28:51', '2020-07-22 02:28:51', '', 0, 'https://cognitive.com.sg/?p=3966', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In the meantime, our lives have all been impacted significantly. As with many other countries, Singapore enforced a lockdown as part of measures taken to curtail the spread of the virus. During a lockdown, most citizens were not allowed to go to work or school. Most places, like malls and offices, were also shut down. Most of us are confined to our homes and can only leave for essential purposes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEducation is one sector that has been impacted greatly. Classes can no longer be done face-to-face, with most of schools implementing online classes in order to replace the usual face-to-face classroom learning. However, this new mode of learning is novel and comes with its own sets of challenges. As a result, some students are facing some difficulties with adapting to these changes. However, there are some things that we can do as parents in order to better facilitate this learning process and to help them transition effectively and smoothly into online learning. Here are some pointers:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Follow a schedule</b></strong>\n\n<strong><b> </b></strong>\n\nTime management is essential during this period of time as your child might be more prone to distraction as things like toys and the television are now in closer proximity. They might also feel more relaxed and unmotivated to do work as they are in the comforts of their own home. To combat this, we can set up a time schedule for your child to follow. This will allow them to have a clearer idea of what to expect for the day ahead, and what they should accomplish for the day. It is also crucial to schedule breaks in between to allow them to recharge and relax before they start on work again. After a day’s work, you can also give vocal compliments or reward your child for following the schedule well. This will give them an added motivation to follow the schedule that you have set for them in future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Set</b></strong><strong><b>ting up a designated study area</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClassrooms are effective since the students know intuitively that it is a place to study and learn. As such, when they enter the classroom, children will subconsciously transition into a mindset of learning. Similarly, we can also craft out a designated study area at home so that your children will know that it is time to learn when they are in that area. It is important to also design this study area in such a way where it promotes learning. Preferably, it should be bright with good ventilation for the child to feel comfortable. Distractions should also be kept far away in this study area, so that they are able to better focus on their work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Working closely with your children’s teachers</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTeachers are usually more familiar with your children’s academic ability and how best to facilitate their learning. Hence, they might have some useful pointers, not only in setting up a designated study area at home, but also the most effective way to teach your child. Hence, it will be good to work closely with your child’s teacher so that your child’s learning experience is enhanced. Forming a support group with other parents is also recommended as it can be a platform where experiences, concerns and tips can be shared.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Keeping them active and busy</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChildren are naturally active and love to be outdoors. Excessive energy will cause them to be fidgety and unable to focus on their work. This might be an issue during this pandemic as most outdoor areas like parks and playgrounds are closed. Hence, we have to find ways for them to keep active while at home. This can be done by engaging them in various activities like baking, cooking or even exercising at home. There is a plethora of  online videos that are offering tutorials in all of these areas. They can even be taught how to do simple household chores like sweeping the floor. This provides opportunities to teach them about initiative and responsibility as well. Lastly, with more time spent at home, this can be an excellent opportunity for them to discover new hobbies such as reading, painting or playing a musical instrument.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'Facilitating Your Child\'s Learning At Home During COVID-19', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'facilitating-your-childs-learning-at-home-during-covid-19', '', '', '2021-01-15 03:54:09', '2021-01-15 03:54:09', '', 0, 'https://cognitive.com.sg/?p=4036', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In fact, some of our daily activities have been linked or are dependent on social media. We use social media for personal and business purposes. We use it to communicate and stay in touch with friends and relatives all around the world. We use it to transact and do business online even when we are miles apart. In a way, social media has changed our lives and made it a lot easier.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe group of people who is arguably the most affected by this social media rise is the young children. In the past, children will go outdoors to play and socialize. Now, they stay at home to play online games or chat with their friends on social media.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe introduction of social media into our society has also changed the way we raise our children. Children who grow up in this digital age are different from children who grew up playing outdoors. Growing up with social media has both its advantages and disadvantages. Here are some reasons why social media can be both a benefit and a threat to children.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Positive Effects of Social Media</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>A medium to socialize</li>\n</ul>\nSocial media has become an avenue for children to connect and socialize with their friends. Through social media, they can expand their network by meeting new friends online and keeping in touch and building a stronger relationship with their current ones.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Learn new skills</li>\n</ul>\nThere is a wide range of learning content available online. From the simplest “how to’s” and general knowledge to technical information, there is nothing that cannot be found on the Internet. The digital age has made it easier for children to research on things they do not know. This helps them in their studies and in enhancing their personal knowledge. Platforms like Youtube provide content that can help your child learn things that they do not learn in school.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>An avenue to express themselves</li>\n</ul>\nSocial media provides a place for young people to express themselves. The way they customize their social media accounts into something that reflects their personality. It also provides a platform for them to showcase their skills and talents to the public. So many popular artists and talents nowadays are first discovered through social media.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Exposure to current events</li>\n</ul>\nIt is often a difficult task to get children to read the newspaper or even watch the news. They perceive these things as boring and they would rather read comics or watch cartoons. Nowadays, social media readily provides bite-sized information on current events and is able to reach a wider audience. It helps children to be more aware of what is happening in the community and around the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Negative Effects of Social Media</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Social media addiction</li>\n</ul>\nSocial media is very addicting. Many children spend most of their hours scrolling through the content on the Internet. This addiction creates a detachment from reality and may even severely hinders the child’s day-to-day routine.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Lesser physical interaction with peers</li>\n</ul>\nInstead of physically bonding and catching up with friends and family, young people are instead more focused on their phones during social gatherings. They miss out on the opportunity to socialize because they are too attached to social media.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Seeking self-validation through social media</li>\n</ul>\nYoungsters are obsessed with the ‘likes’ and ‘hearts’ they gain from their friends or followers. This causes a psychological effect known as self-validation. It develops a need to always look good in everything that they post online because they think that the number of ‘likes’ they receive is correspondent to their own self-worth.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li>Cyberbullying and exposure to violent content</li>\n</ul>\nAs much as it provides entertainment and joy to most of us, social media has also been a source of negativity for some. Cyberbullying is easier to engage in due to the anonymity involved. Moreover, constant exposure to violent content can result in the child being desensitized to such content in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><b>Regulating your child’s use of social media</b></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs mentioned above, social media has a lot of benefits. However, too much of anything is never good. In order to keep things balanced and to enjoy the perks of social media, we should learn how to regulate the use of it. For parents, you should always keep an eye on their online activities to prevent them from viewing violent or obscene content.
